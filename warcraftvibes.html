        <span style="color: #f4d257; font-size: 20px";>22 years ago,</span> me and my brother walked into Electronics Botique for Warcraft III. It wasn't hard to find. We walked up to the rack where people were all around. My brother reached for the Night Elf box with the lady on it, I went for Undead. I grabbed it with both hands and just looked at it, brought it close to my face. It smelled like Office Max.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every time you get a new game, you have to open it on the way home and read the manual. Turn the light on in the back so mom can't see shit while you learn about armor types. We needed it. It made us slippery for the campaign, which was happening tonight.
    </p>

    <p>
        We were heading south from the mall, passing cars that didn't have Warcraft III in them. I was in the back reading the manual, taking the olympic bumps of rte 206 like a champ. They shook my entire body, and the manual, every time. But I kept reading. I held the booklet with two hands.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we pulled in, I had a good idea of what I was in for. Truthfully, I didn't have a clue. I thought I was going to have a good time but was about to get scalped and teabagged in the best way possible.
    </p>
    <img class="imgflex" oncontextmenu="return false;"" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/pls-everything-else/compost_heap/ea/warcraft/vibes/Human_RoCk.jpg">
       <p>
        I am immediately in awe of the campaign. Artists made this game.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're role playing as Prince Arthas, a paladin that heals shit and swings a hammer. He's a decent, angry guy. Then just an angry guy.
       </p>
       <p>
        A few hours into playing, we're approached by a footman who gives us a status report. It takes us a second to acknowledge because we're staring off into the distance in some unhinged daydream. Our face is covered in shadow, already locked into being an evil bastard. We're totally screwed and we know it. It's sad. 
       </p>
      <p>
        I feel like my hand's being forced, but I want the powerful sword as much as Arthas does. We're two peas in a pod. Anything to run it through that abhorrent Malganis clown. I killed him five times at Stratholme but he keeps coming back.
      </p>

   <p>
    <span style="color: #f4d257; font-size: 20px";>After campaign, I entered Battle.net.</span> The multiplayer area. It was suddenly Dali's Slave Market where you think you're looking at a face but it's really two nuns. I thought campaign was the whole thing but there was another game behind it.
   </p>
   <p>
    BNet was like a tavern. It was smoky and there was music playing. Someone laughed, another guy got punched in the face. There were no rules, people made their own. This is where everyone was.
   </p>
   <p>
    In 2024, everyone admits Warcraft III did it best, tavern style, but no one's building a tavern.
   </p>
   <img class="imgflex" oncontextmenu="return false;" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/pls-everything-else/compost_heap/ea/warcraft/vibes/ms5.jpg">
   <p>
    When I enter BNet, I land on the basic UI and news page. I spam <span style="color: #f4d257;";><b>c</b></span> to get into chat.
   </p>
   <p>
    I check who's online with <span style="color: #adadf8; font-size: 18px; font-family: courier; font-weight: 700;">/f l</span>. I can have a max of 25 friends. There is an indication that a friend is mutual or if they haven't added me yet. <span style="color: #adadf8; font-size: 18px; font-family: courier; font-weight: 700;">/f a</span> <span style="color: #1ec79d; font-size: 18px; font-family: courier; font-weight: 700;"> wilted_kale</span>. To speak to all my friends at once, I type <span style="color: #adadf8; font-size: 18px; font-family: courier; font-weight: 700;">/f m</span> and then my message. To speak to just one, I whisper with <span style="color: #adadf8; font-size: 18px; font-family: courier; font-weight: 700;">/w</span>. 
   </p>
   <p>
    There is a limit to friends and channels and game slots and everything. Limits feel good. Smallness too. I am way more connected on Warcraft III BNet than I will ever be on facebook, twitter or instagram.
   </p>

   <p>
    The secret society of BNet is symbiotic with the custom games tab at the top of the screen, the scroll parchment. We all find each other by bouncing around or meeting in a game. When the game ends we end up back in these chat channels to talk about it. And it grows from there.
   </p>
    <p>
    Custom games is like going to the arcade without leaving your house. I go often. It doesn't seem like there'd be much of a game without it. Everyone on my friends list is a DotA player.  
   </p>

    Warcraft III is a real object. There are so many unlocked doors. I start with campaign, roll over into custom games, and am exploring 1v1 ladder at the same time. Luckily, some of my custom game friends are ladder barbarians. Especially one.
   </p>
   <p>
    I watch my friend Mike snap sternums in 1v1. He's a magician. His current account is 43-4. He creep-jacks with coil, does unconventional builds, micros well. Most of the people he plays are dough-eyed lambs but I'm still in awe. Mike teaches me so much about what it means to be good at games. 
   </p>
   <p>
    When I play 1v1 ladder, I just lame people. I entangle and focus their heroes with mass dryads. This is before I learn about micro. I'm gunning for those ladder icons, though. 25 wins for a pretty one. I can't win more than 56% of the time but it's enough for a screaming ghoul face.
   </p>

   <p>
    I feel like I can spend an eternity on BNet. Part of me thinks I will. But it'll all be over far too soon.
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="color: #f4d257; font-size: 20px";>Warcraft III is the last game I truly loved.</span> I was lucky enough to experience it in the prime time. It showed me what I wanted by doing exactly what <i>it</i> wanted. A lot of modern games try to be what they think players want, which feels backwards and leads to a lack of truly great games.

   <p>
    The creators of Warcraft were the audience just as much as we were, so when they made it for themselves they were also making it for us.
   </p>
   <p>
    12 year-olds like boomer stuff, too. 22 years later I'm 12Â½ and still get excited about Warcraft III.
