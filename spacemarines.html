                    Chapter 1: A Spherical Threat
                </b>
            </p>
            <p>
                "The threat of the Zerg grows longer Lutenit, and they are cutting through our blockades."
            </p>
            <p>
                "We can't increase our ship number more than it can be Lutenit Orno, the Protoss are blocking off most of the planets remotely close to the sun. The ones we need," <b>Lutenit Estolav</b> stated. Both of the Terran officers stood on circular pads, with blue lighting outlining the circle. They were both on different battle-cruisers. It's the best communnication the Terran have.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I will bring this matter to the Captain," Lutenit Orno said and walked off the pad, terminating the audio and visual of the communication. Estolav snapped himself a grin and walked off his pad in a professional manner and walked on to the door. He tapped in a code and it slowly opened. Three men were on the other side to greet him. One was the Generall and the other two were members of the Dominion council.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What is it now," Estolav groaned, on the verge of crying. He had gone through far more than he wanted his limits to be.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Can I have a word with you please?" the Generall pointed his finger at Estolav.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It's been two hundred and fifty years since meetings were in vogue Generall, I hope this is work related," Estolav gave an easily spoken incentive for <b>Generall Tutos</b> to give him a bloody nose. But Tutos understood that Estolav had a rough day.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes it is work related, and can we discuss this in my room?" it was more of a demand/order than a question. The title "Generall" gave Tutos all the power that he wanted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Estolav followed him down a adjacent hallway to where they just were. The Dominion council members followed stiffly. On the walls there was a number 5. The higher you go, the higher in rank you are. And, obviously, the nicer and bigger it gets. 5 is pretty high too. It goes up to 8 and that is where Generall Tutos stopped walking. Estolav was in 6 and hopefully, to himself, was hoing to get promoted to Major, skipping computer training that came before.
            </p>
            <p>
                The door to Tutos's room opened and metals, awards, old armor, signatures, etc. were behind glass, thick windows, and carefully placed on a formal cotton fabric. The four men sat down and got right to business.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Before I begin, Lutenit Estolav, these two men are here to take part in our military discussions. They were sent by Dominion Generall Kelsoff," Tutos stated briefly and reached in his briefcase. He pulled out several folders and piled them on the table.
            </p>
            <p>
                "How was your discussion with Lutenit Orno?" Tutos examined the files.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Stupid, boring, and a totall waste of time," Estolav snapped.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well put," Tutos said and pulled out a small file.
            </p>
            <p>
                "He wants us to go to war with the Protoss. We're in no position to do so, even if we wanted to," Estolav added.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Then what should be done?" Tutos asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You agree with that snake!" Estolav raised his voice at the end.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It's the only remaining solution. You think I want to go to war?" Tutos asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We all pick our battles," Estolav said. Tutos smiled and further looked at the file that lay silently before him.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The Protoss are too strong, and we are too week right now, Orno has a mind of stupidity and war," Estolav said, with a growl at the end.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well, the Protoss are blocking the mines, and we need the minerals so Lutenit Orno is right, we have no other choice but war," Tutos said. "I will gear you up and give you orders for squads 7-15. Understood?" Tutos asked and lit up a cigar. Lutenit Estolav couldn't believe his eyes and ears. It was fighting, after war after fighting, he felt like nothing had ever gone anywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Dismissed Lutenit," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes," Estolav agreed softly and walked out. He went to the academy and found his armor there. "This isn't happening," he says to himself, and programs in hs size, the date and his name on the info card to the side of the armor. His rifle and side-arm were in the locker right to his left, but he knew he didn't want to fire it. Minutes later the door swung open and fully armored, fit and ready marines walked in. In front was <b>Colonel Narta</b>, in a marine outfit only with teal markings and not blue. Estolav quickly put on his armor.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Welcome to the team Lutenit. My second in command officer without a smile, come on soldier, get a move on it," Narta said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Narta was no drill Sargeant but he sure acted like one. After Estolav was suited up he looked through his field book. He examined closely what exactly they all were about to engage in. His jaw dropped.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Battle cruiser set a course toward the mining fields of Aloon. Not too far from the sun but not the same sun earth relied on.
            </p>
            <p>
                "When spotted, land and unload men, alert all other Terran vessels in the area, we're going to need help on this one," Tutos said, and slid across the <s>ground</s> floor on his chair over to his computer, where it showed camera views of the whole Battlecruiser.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, this isn't happening," Estolav whispered to himself. The ship started to enter the atmosphere of Aloon.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I can smell the scum of Protoss allready, can't you?" Narta asked the crew. They all raised their rifles and cheered.
            </p>
            <p>
                The trap for the Terran was set...
            </p>
            <br />
            <p><b>Chapter 2, Protoss encounters...</b></p>
            <p>
                The Battle cruiser just floated down,
            </p>
            <p>
                "Descending to 2 miles."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Get ready!" Narta yelled. Estolav lowered his helmet as he and the crew cocked their rifles.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Prepare for death!" Narta yelled to his crew. They all cheered. Estolav felt his dog tags beaneath his armor and said a prayer.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Prepare to board the dropships!" Narta yelled .The crew of 30 marines in that room jogged out enthusiasticly, and met up with two hunded more. They loaded onto 10 dropships and took off.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Descending to 1 mile." The dropships flew awar from the Battlecruiser. Tutos had radio contact with all the marines and officers. The Battle cruiser stopped decending at 4,000 ft. and started to patroll the airforce ways (checking to see if any Soro ships are in the area). The dropship's pilots spotted the surface.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Scanning."
            </p>
            <p>
                "No signs of Soro life-forms," the pilot says.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Good to go," Narta says. They all give themselves a thumbs up, to make sure they're not so scared they can't move their fingers. Estolav could feel the shaking of the dropship as it approached the surface. Then the sand terrain filled the windows. Then with a horrid last decend the dropship stopped.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Go! Go! Go!" Narta yelled. The marines jogged out onto the dry sand and cautiosly examined their surroundings. Estolav exited last, when two more dropships unloaded.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hold your positions, wait until all squads arrive," Narta ordered.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We're going to beat the Protoss on foot?" a Private asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Vehicles are coming shortly private, and then it's DoomsDay," Narta said and smiled. Their dropship took off. Others were still unloading.
            </p>
            <p>
                "After the others arrive we will go over the hill and then onto from there. Keep your eyes open," Narta said. Estolav nodded. Then the dropships took off from the sandy dry terrain, and the sand rippled outwards by the air current. The marines examined further. Then when they got relatively close Narta gave the order.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay, let's get over this hill!" all 230 some marines heard it and carefully started up the hill. It was just waiting to be explored. As Estolav stepped, his thighs started to burn more and more. Going up a steap hill was not that easy. Narta was taking it like it was an early morning walk. Finally Narta made it right before the top. He signaled all of us to stay low, and prepare for battle. He slowly peered over the hill. The reflection of his helmet gave a look that couldn't be described. His jaw slowly dropped. Estolav then looked for himself. Miles of Protoss rubble and burning buildings lay deserted there.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Sir, the Protoss on the surface have been completely wiped out. Permission to explore Protoss ruins Generall," Narta said into the built in comlink in his hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Repeat that Colonel," Tutos's voice stuttered.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The Protoss have been wiped out, they're gone. Only a few buildings remain standing. Do I have permission to explore the ruins, sir?" Narta asked again sharply.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes," Tutos answered coldly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Back on the Battle-cruiser Generall Tutos contacted all of the Terran that he possibly knew of in the area. He explained the situation and set a rendevous point on space station Uran. One of the biggest space stations the Terran was equipped with.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm going to get my men and then we'll meet you there," he finished with Captain Luran and then pointed to the door. <b>Tarannis</b> left...
            </p>
            <div align="center";>&#42 &#42 &#42</div>
            <p>
                Narta pointed toward the rubble of a photon canon and the marines followed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Okay men, we're going to break into four groups. Find anything, anyone, or locate the mineral field, contact me. Meet back here in 0200 hours. Move out!" Narta yelled. Estolav and four dozen marines followed Narta. Trecking through knee deep rubble, the marines looked around.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Lutenit Estolav, take a squad of men and explore  that gateway, before it falls down. Check everywhere for survivors," Narta ordered. Narta and the other three squads floated around the Gateway looking under large pieces of rubble, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Estolav and his squad searched the unpowered Gateway. The lights at the end of their rifles were on. An unpowered Gateway simply has no power.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Isn't it weird that there aren't any bodies?" Estolav said. It was more of a statement than a question.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't know about you but I'm getting a bit creeped out here, this place leaks more than my water bed."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh my God," Estolav said. It was Terran blood on a small piece of rubble.
            </p>
            <p>
                "This is not good," Estolav repeated. Two marines looked over his shoulder looking at the red, runny blood drop off the piece of rubble.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Get me a sample tube now!" Estolav demanded. One of the marines took two empty tubes from a built in pocket and handed them to Estolav. Estolav held it under the rubble and waited. Soon the tube was half full. "Take this to Narta, no hold on, we won't yet, let's proceed," Estolav said. Estolav slipped the tube into his built in pocket along with the empty tube. Everything in the Gateway seems sort of...distorted. The cryo tubes, the training hall are all out of perportion. Estolav and his squad made their way out Narta was 10 yards away from the doorway and his rifle was away across his back.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Narta, we have a problem," Estolav stammered.
            </p>
            <p>
                "How can this situation get any worse," Narta asked still not looking at Estolav, then he turned.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I found Terran blood in the Gateway," Estolav answered.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well that's never good, did you take a sample?" Narta asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, but I'll hold onto it Colonel," Estolav said. Narta stared at Lutenit Estolav.
            </p>
            <p>
                "One thing you have to know is that I'm Colonel, you're Lutenit, of story. Give m the blood sample," Narta ordered.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I can't do that," Estolav said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh you really need to learn your place private!" Narta yelled.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I am not a private, I will hand it to Generall Tutos myself, when we get back to Alpha!" Estolav demanded. At that moment there was a voice.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Marines, prepare for pick-up." It was a dropship pilot.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I want that in my hand by the time those dropships come, or I will relieve you of your command."
            </p>
            <p>
                Estolav ground his teeth and then reached into his pocket. He took the tube out and gave it to Narta.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Good choice," Narta said, and rallied up the marines. "All squards meet back, prepare for pick up."
            </p>
            <p>
                What was Terran blood doing in a Soro Gateway, and how did it get there? Questions rode through Estolav's mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The dropships should be there shortly," Tutos's ovice whistlyed through the privates' helmets.
            </p>
            <p>
                "All squads accounted for," a private stammered next to Narta.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay, do we have a photo of this?" Narta asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes sir, one of the privates in my squad has it now sir," the private said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Good, onward over the hill!" Narta ordered. The marines raced over the hill.
            </p>
            <p>
                A small dark dot beneath the sandy clouds came into view. Misison status was unknown. They were going to take out the promise the Soro had offered them. Peace. And only because the Soro left them with no other option. Blocking off crop and mineral gathering proposes a threat to the Terran race. 
            </p>
            <p>
                More black dots came into view, but the first one was clearly visible. The dropship landed on the ground and marines hurried on.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Back to the ship, we have a lot to talk about," Estolav looked pissed and blocked the thought by just not thinking of anything. More and more dropships came and soon all of the marines were loaded on. Narta sat across from Estolav and so did almost a dozen marines. "What is the answer to the riddle?" Estolav thought to himself as the dropship took off. Terran blood, that means a previous mission took place not too long ago. But where were all the bodies? Someone in the Terran ranks was going behind Estolav's back. Someone high in rank and...the thought didn't make sense. But in Estolav's mind it did fit in a way. He thought back. There were two men from the Dominion council at the meeting. That was suspicious. But Tutos would have known about it and that makes Tutos involved. No, there had to be a better solution. But Estolav's thoughts kept tracking back to General Tutos. He wanted to make everyone think that he liked the Incumbants by bringing in the two representatives. Forming a shield for himself, tricking people into thinking that he wouldn't ever set up or do anything bad to the Incumbants.
            </p>
            <p>
                It all started to come together as the dropship jolted. They were back on battle cruiser Alpha.
            </p>

            <p>
                The ramp to the dropship lowered and pressure was released from the pipes in a myst form. The marines walked down and went immediately to the Academy. So did Narta. But Estolav didn't. He walked straight for Tutos's quarters. His fist was clenched and his mood was showed by the expression on his face. As he turned the hall of quadrant "8", Tutos's door showed a red, meaning you couldn't come in. Estolav felt like he could take down the titanium door no problem. Then there were voices. It sounded like, well, not Terran. Estolav solved the puzzle. It was Tutos going behing everyone's back. To unarmored marines were making their way up the 8 hall.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Private, I need this door opened," Estolav said.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can't do it, try someone else," the marine said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reluctantly, Estolav took his rifle from his back and pointed it dead center of the dooor.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You pick your battles, Tutos," he said, and pulled the trigger.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bullets started to tare through. Then Estolav got to the side of it and reloaded. The two marines came back.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What the hell do you think you're doing, that's the General!" one said. Then Estolav empited another 100 rounds into the door. It bent, and was twisted. Estolav then gave one huge, powerful kick into the biggest bend and it fell down. A man in a full back suit, and advanced small goggles, stood next to Tutos. Tutos was staring right at Estolav.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You are under arrest for treason, wat the hell were you thinking private?" Tutos yelled.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You think I'm stupid. There was a good chance that was a suicide mission, and you sent us right in there!" Estolav raised his voice over Tutos's voice.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What are you talking about, you are way out of line!" Tutos yelled. People started to gather around the toasted door.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You know very well what I mean," Estolav said. "You set up the Dominion, sending them, assuring them minerals when they died, it doesn't stop there. Why not kill 2 birds with 1 stone, making the Dominion lose hundreds, and maybe thousands of men, while the Protoss loses a 3 mile base each way, and then you send us in for clean up, knowing that there could of been hundreds of Protoss or Dominion still left. Then you, or your ally, the black suited person over there, cleaned out all the bodies, trying to hide all of this from us. But what you did do stupid, and what you should do for next time, is just clean out the Dominion bodies, that's the only REAL secret, right? Or did you want to try and totally fake us out?" Estolav ended.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You have no evidence, and there isn't any, you're wrong," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Am I? Then you won't mind if I explain this to the men throughout the battle-cruiser!" Estolav said, and started to walk out. But at that moment two men blocked the doorway.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I already told you, you are under arrest. Bring him to the room and keep him there until we meet the other Terran forces at the Rendezvous point," Tutos ordered. The men pulled Estolav out of hte room, kicked him in the back of the knee. Estolav fell down and they dragged him.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You don't know what you're doing!" Estolav said. The marines stopped. They took his armor off and injected drugs into his blood. Estolav felt paralyzed from the neck down. His vision was blurry and he couldn't speak a clear word.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Wa, wa, yo, do, not, how when your doing!" he yelled, and then the marined kicked his head into the floor.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Tell your leader that the plans are in order, and tell him thank you for helping us get the mines back," Tutos said. The black suited man made his way back to the docking bay, to his small black ship. Tutos sat at his desk and started to program in the hailing frequency for the Kara'Thak race (their ships).
            </p>
            <p>
                Estolav felt the blood from his head trinkle down to his shirt. He tried to feel the ground but everything was num. He groaned in disbelief. A Lutenit in prizon just didn't appeal to the truth. Lutenits should be, if anything, spoiled. Not falsely charged for treason and thrown in a flying prizon. He felt the battle cruiser turn. They were leaving the atmosphere of planet Aloon. He then closed his eyes again and thought of just flying away from everything, and everyone. He thought of a way to escape.
            </p>
            <p>
                Narta stepped out of the Academy and walked to hallway 7. Then he entered his room code and walked in. He didn't see Estolav at the academy and thought about it. The last thing he remembered was Estolav angry. He got his side-arm from his pocket and put a clip in it. He put it back in, then ran to to hallway 8.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tutos looked out the window into the blankets of darkness in space. His cigar happily found a groove in his teeth and he was puffing it ever so slowly.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We will arrive at the space station in an hour General," the pilot of the battle cruiser said. Tutos was in his 40s, young for a General, but walked with a slight cruch. He was attacked by a hydralisk when he was ranked Lutenit at age 20. He was a marine since the age of 14 and squad leader at 15. Tutos then sat down. Two men were at his door with repair kits and several sheets of new metal. Then Narta walked in.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh hi Colonel, please come in," Tutos said. Narta slowly walked in.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What happened with your door General?" Narta asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Lutenit Estolav shot it down and came in yelling, accusing me of false things," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What false things would they bee General," Narta said in a wicked tone.
            </p>
            <p>
                "He said I set the team up, just to kill a few Dominion soldiers!" Tutos explained. "And I talked with a Protoss, high ranked representative. The Dominion attacked themselves, trying to take our right to those mines. The Protoss knew we didn't do it, luckily, we didn't get to them before the Dominion did, or the whole team would of been killed!" Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "How do you explain all the bodies being gone?" Narta sked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The Protoss cleared them out, it's a tradition, they don't want any trace of their battles with others," Tutos made a very good argument.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Where is Lutenit Estolav now?" Narta was afraid to hear any answer but alive. He valued the lives of his men and was a very curious and intelligent person.
            </p>
            <p>
                "He is in wing 1a, and won't be coming out," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Prizon! Forever!" Narta yelled.
            </p>
            <p>
                "He threatened the life of me and the Kar'Athak representative who was here," Tutos had made a tiny slip.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Kar'Athak?" Narta said slowly and swallowed his anger.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The last time we trusted them, they turned on us. You want that to happen again?" Narta ended calmly.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, we, I, know, what's gooing on, I have it covered," Tutos said, returning in the same pleasant soft voice.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We are coming up on space station, get ready, prepare all squads to meet Cpt. Uran and his team. Which includes Lutenit Orno."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes sir," Narta said lightly, and walked out.
            </p>

                Estolav started to get his ability to feel back. His vision still had a strong blur to it. He got up, he saw the vague outline of the blue bars of electricity, and the metal walls around him. He was convinced that the hard rock like/metal floor was his death bed. There was no longer anyone he could trust. He had disobeyed Narta. Yelled at his General, and put himself into the deepest part of the hole. There was no way to escape a military, Terran prizon. He thought he was probably going to be transfered to onto a space station prizon, or a planet prizon. Both of which are twice as bad, and much harder to escape from. Just then the blue lines of electric flows faded and soon dissapeared. They must of gotten to a transfering station, or landed on a planet. Two hands grabbed him from behind, and dragged him across the floor.
            </p>
            <p>
                He tried to fight it but his strength was gone. All he had were memories and thoughts. His back was getting scraped on the metal and his struggle was no use, even in his mind. What was going to happen was certainly out of his hands, and into the person's hands that was vigorously dragging him. Then they stopped, a door opened and he was dragged onto carpet, and then the person let go. His head hit hard to the floor. He saw a blur of the person. He was tall, and was wearing all black. Now a Kar'Athak wants to kill him? Oh, a day full of surprises, Estolav thought and just lied there. But the person took the black mask off, he was human.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Who are you?" Estolav reluctantly asked and tightened up.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Be still," the voice said. It was Narta's voice.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What? Why, how what?" Estolav stammered through his words. Narta was working at a small table, with a bunch of utencils, and then after a minute or two brought over a needle. It felt good.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Your vision should come back shortly," Narta said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why did you help me?" Estolav asked, still lying there.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I care about my fellow men, and race, there aren't any reasons why I wouldn't," Narta said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "How did you know I was there?" Estolav said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Tutos told me. Why did you break down the door, and falsely accuse him of all these—"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I didn't, those are all true, you believe him I know, but I put the puzzle together and I know exactly what he's doing. He's getting back the mineral fields by making the Dominion and Protoss kill each other off. And the Kar'Athak are with him for now because he promised them some minerals. Don't you see it? the Terran blood?" Estolav tried to explain.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yeah, the Terran blood is being interpreted now," Narta said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I garuntee you it's Dominion blood," Estolav's vision slowly came back. There was a knock at the dooor.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hide," Narta whispered.
            </p>
            <p>
                Estolav dove under the bed. Narta unlocked the door by entering the code on the key-pad next to the door. He opened the door. It was marine.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We're approaching the space station, Colonel," he said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay, thanks," Narta answered. He closed the door and walked back. "Okay," Narta said. Estolav crawled out. Then Narta took a robe from his closet.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What's this for? Halloween?" Estolav asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Always be prepared. Put this on, you're an ambassador. Stay with me," Narta said. Then grabbed his side-arm. It was very much like a desert eagle. By that time, Estolav had the robe on, and pulled over the hood.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Here, take this," Narta handed him a small pistol. "Just in case."
            </p>
            <p>
                The Battle cruiser Alpha stopped moving and Narta and Estolav walked out.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Stay quiet," and that was the end of the talking. Many men walked down the halls. Estolav was going to explain what he thinks to Cpt. Uran, and maybe he'll believe him. But they walked. They were attached to the space station. Tutos was in view. Estolav tapped his gun in anger. Tutos was driving the Terran down hill with no breaks. Finally, they got around to the space station Link entrnace and walked in. It was a huge room to start. Hundreds of workers roamed. Only 30 people from Alpha came on to the space station. General Tutos shook hands with people when <b>Cpt. Uran</b>, Lutenit Orno, and ten men with special suits walked in.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Welcome, we all are here to discuss what's the best solution to get back our mineral fields, which the Protoss stole from us," Uran said. "Please, a statement from General Tutos." Uran sat and Tutos stood.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We, a strike team landed on planet Aloon, finding only Protoss ruins. I think, along with my other officials, another race took them out," Tutos paused. Estolav remember learning that tutos thought the Dominion did it. But Tutos told him he didn't et them up. It started to get confusing again, why exactly Tutos would say a different race now. Estolav listened closely for more.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The best thing to do now is to get the Protoss where they are weak. To the next planet of where thy have our minereals, Aloon's brethren moon, this is the perfec time." More evidence just leaked from Tutos' mouth. He soon would be found out.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, I agree, this is the perfect time General Tutos, and the consperacy of the Protoss base being destroyed, will shortly be discovered," Uran said. Even though he was a Captain, he was in higher rank than General Tutos. Lutenit Orno stood while Tutos sat down.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, we can't go to war, I talked with Lutenit Estolav and by the end of our discsison, I knew we would be making a mistake if we did go to war with anyone!" Orno said. "We can resolve this by meeting with Protoss ranked people, and most likely work this out."
            </p>
            <p>
                Tutos stood abruptly.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, I don't think we can. We've tried numerous times and all they do is close the hailing frequency and continue being Protoss. Intelligent, but an enemy for sure," General Tutos ended. Estolav hoped a Protoss, one Protoss anywhere, heard that. He remembered Tutos telling him that he had a friendly meeting with the Protoss, now Tutos is stating that we should go to war with them.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's simple logic, too. Without minerals, there isn't any repairing done, no money to buy machines, or parts to ships and vehicles. Without minerals, there was no way they were in any position to fight them. Any race who fought the Terran had a good chance at this point. But especially the Protoss. A large base being destroyed does not give any advantages to the Terran. Now Tutos got the Kar'Athak involved, which could easily overturn and could backfire. There was only one word in Estolav's head at the moment, <i>impeachment</i>. Tutos had to retire, not because of his age, but because of his stupidity and his ways of dealing with issues. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Uran stood up. Estolav hoped the decision would be a good one. He waited.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We shall go to the moon of Aloon and simply take back our mineral field, using any means necessary. General Tutos, you and your men, with mine, will go down to Alsays, and take back the mineral field. Report back when you have it," Uran said.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                <b>Chapter 4: The mines of Alsays</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Men departed from the common room off into small airlocked entrance spaces. There was noise so Estolav quietly spoke to Narta.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Go down, I need to talk with Uran," he said. Spartan nodded and made his way to one of the dropships. Armor sat on the shelves. The marines started to stuit up with rifles and handguns, grenades and knives. It was a very abrupt call on a mission, and Narta was worried. In his dropship was a rookie <b>Lutenit Corseal</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Suit up, Lutenit, one of our biggest missions is ahead of us, and it's your first day of being Lutenit in this squad. Your smile is not like your luck," Narta said. Corseal took it in.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Get used to him, it gets worse," a marine said, as they continued to suit up. Tutos was in the dropship next to the one Narta was in.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Departure in 5 minutes," the voice echoed through the dropships.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Estolav crept down the hall, following Uran until he got next to him.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Captain Uran?" Estolav asked. "I'm Lutenit Estolav with the confederates, as are you. I've come to you with a problem that I highly doubt you know about." Estolav explained the whole story.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Narta sat down in a seat closest to the back door/entrance/exit of the dropship. Corseal and the other marines sat as well, rifle base on the ground, barrel pointing up. The audio frequency of all the squads turned on, and so did the infer red option in the helmets.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Everyone good to go?" Narta asked. The men in his dropship gave him a thumbs up. Then through his comlink, he heard the marines in the 20 other dropships say "good to go."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Departure in one minute," the voice said over the speaker in the dropships.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Estolav was expecting the same thing he got from Tutos but it was worth a try.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Umm, let's continue this inside," Uran said and they both walked in the door.
            </p>
            <p>
                "So you're saying General Tutos met with a Protoss executive?" Uran asked, and they both sat down.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes," Estolav answered simply.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We got the results of the blood Colonel Narta sent in," Uran said. Estolav waited, sat there, and then Uran spoke.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It does match with a Dominion marine's blood, and he came up deceased. But there is no evidence that General Tutos set the Dominion up, do you have any?" Uran asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," Estolav said slowly. All his thoughts were in his head, not on tape, or on audio tape. He thought of how he could change the thoughts of Uran. But his thoughts ended abruptly, and no resolutions were found.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                The dropships' entrances closed and the marines felt a jolt. The dropships departed from the space station. 20 dropships with 20 men in each.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Men, prepare for the biggest ground assault in the history of our race. Good luck," Narta said and breathed slowly. The moon of Aloon was a field/forest planet, and very big.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The mineral fields are located north of the main Protoss base. We can't land after te base because there are too many heavily supported defenses. We are accompanied by 20 wraiths, 4 battlecruisers, and 3 valkyries. Be prepared for anything," Narta added.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We all know that when the Confederacy supports us with that kind of fleet, something big is down there to greet us," Narta said, and sat silent.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm new to the squad but not new to battle, I'm <b>Major Arkanine</b>, Firebat S.O.D., my team consists of 2 dropships of firebats and a dropship of medics. Every Protoss I see will iss my boot, or die trying before I toast his ass!" Arkanine yelled.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Don't be over-confident Major, the Protoss are smarter and stronger than you say, they can put a few strikes into you before you get your boot out," Narta said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Aloon's moon showing up on radar now," a dropship pilot stated.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Roger that," the rest repeated. Radar distance of a dropship was  miles. That was a need.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Several scouts circling moon, they are expecting us," the pilot followed up.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Don't stop, go straight through the bastards! Wraiths, take out when we get close," Tutos ordered. "Battle-cruisers, follow us down to the planet," he added.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Make no mistake gentlemen," Narta said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "In firing range now," the co pilot said. time wnet in slow motion as orange energy gathered at the front of the four battle cruisers, then let go. 4 orange energy blasts tore through the planet's atmosphere and hit the surface.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Wraiths, go in," Tutos ordered.
            </p>
            <p>
                The wraiths went into attack position and their missile bays lowered.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Battle cruisers, Alpha, and dropships, follow your present course," Tutos demanded. Through the windows of the cockpits of the dropships and battle cruisers, the wraiths fought a dozen scouts. Explosions, so on, were coming from the scene.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Entering moon atmosphere, status is stable," the dropship pilot said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Orno, the lutenit of the wraiths, shot a set of two gemini missiles. A scout passed close to him when two his th scout in the side. The explosion crackled and Orno swept up the mess of another scout.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                "So Lutenit Estolav, I will have a meeting with General Tutos myself and see what he says, when he comes back," Uran said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "If he comes back," Estolav thought.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Thanks again," Estolav said, and walked out.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                "Descending to 2 miles," the co pilot said. The 3 battle cruiser normals were in back of the dropships. Alpha was in front.
            </p>
            <p>
                "First sight of ground forces spotted," the pilot of Alpha said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Land here, let's take these guys out first!" Tutos yelled. The dropships kept on descending.
            </p>
            <p>
                "One mile."
            </p>
            <p>
                A wraith received two scout missiles, sending it in flames and exploding a few seconds later. Theh scouts set up in a formation of straight assault.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Watch your six W-2," Orno said. A wraith jolted left and two missiles barely missed him. Orno gasped and followed another scout tight. He fired, the scout dodged one but the other hit the back and only knocked our his shields.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alpha followed closely, all ships were in contact with the space station and Uran.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dropships were a couple hundred feet from the ground when they spotted a group of Protoss, not firing.
            </p>
            <p>
                "They aren't firing sir, your oders?" the dropship pilot asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Land! Then we'll take it from there," Tutos ordered. Keeping their distance, the 20 dropships landed then slowly, cautiously unloaded. 30 Protoss stood in the tall grass. But when Narta came closer he deciphered that they were nothing of Protoss.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We are not here to kill you, we want to know who you are," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                They were a little bigger than human sized, with gel like armor and big, puffy alien heads. They had organic cammoed claws and sharp, alien teeth.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Leave now," one said, it was a deep and scratchy voice.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Look, we just want our mineral fields back so we can live, we don't want to fight you," Narta said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Leave now," the same one said. 
            </p>
            <p>
                These people, if you could even call them that, could not be reasoned with. It was either live or die at this point.
            </p>
            <p>
                Narta flipped out hhis rifle and aimed it at the group of the new race. Along with 100 other marines.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You aren't wise to fight us. We quadruple your numbers and that number rises!" the beast yelled.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Not after I get through with you and rest of your race," Narta said. "Fire!" he yelled. Rife fire frome the marines ripped through the gel like armor and into their flesh.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Proceed!" Tutos yelled with his rifle in hand. The beasts fell, shedding red blood.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No time to waste. Onward!" Narta yelled. Over the slight hill, thousands of beasts roamed. And there were the mineral fields.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Swallow your pride and kill the bastards!" The 400 men jogged down the hill.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Orno jerked right. "Commence full attack!" he yelled. The wraiths grouped up.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Call off the wraiths, we're not fighting the Protoss!" Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                He started to empty rounds into the beasts when spines came over top and struck the armor of th marines. The beasts charged the marines.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Get ready for hell!" Narta yelled.
            </p>
            <p>
                Orno received the order. "all wraiths drop back, I'll hail the scouts and say it was a simple miss-understanding!" Orno said into his comlink. The scouts stopped firing.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Thank God," Orno said.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                A marine went down taking 30 spines in the chest. Rifle fire was constant.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Retreat back over the hill!" Tutos yelled. The four battle cruisers shadowd the field and they shot. One took out one of the beasts. They ran over the hill. Tutos close lined one and stabbed the next with a 20 inch blade. The marines reloaded. That's when the beasts got headway. They jumped on 3 marines and ripped them to shreds, limbs in the air and everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Die!" a marine yelled, blassting the little brains the beasts had. Narta blocked a claw strike with his rifle and then with the back side of it hit the bease in the face. 5 more marines went down.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Firebats!" Narta yelled. A dozen firebats made their way to the front and blew flames forward toasting beasts, and buying time for the marines to reload. When 18 beasts fell the marines were reloaded. The battle raged on. The battle cruisers were picking them off, little by little.
            </p>
            <p>
                "There has to be another thousand!" a marine yelled hostily, and then got his head taken off. Marines were dropping like flies. 380, then soon 375.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Preparing yomato weapon, firing momentarily General," the B.C.s said one by one.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Let's just hold these guys off for a few more minutes then run back, yomato's firing soon!" Tutos yelled while blowing the guts out the back one of one of the beasts. Then from the side, one clawed the side of him.
            </p>
            <p>
                His armor scraped. Then Narta took the beast by the neck and twisted it. A cluster of beasts took down 6 firebats, clawin them open, as they screamed for mercy. The marines in the area shot them off. The orange energy gathered at the weapons bay of the 4 battle cruisers. Then a flicker of light blinded the beasts and the weapons took off, each yomato blast killing 300. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There was silence. Tutos tried to see the smoke but it was too thick. The other 300 marines tried to look too. As it cleared, there was an army, an army of beasts and of...the eyes of all the Terran widened. Then General Tutos stepped bck. Thousands upon thousands of Zerg were standing behind the beasts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Put down your rifles," Narta told his team. They did.
            </p>
            <p>
                Estolav sat in the common room, thinking that they were fighting the Protoss. He had no idea the Zerg and the beasts were involved. He sat with the robe hood down. Then a few people passed. They were talking...
            </p>
            <p>
                "It's not, they are beasts, not Protoss and the Zerg," the voices faded as the people walked further away.
            </p>
            <p>
                Estolav didn't move. He gave up thinking, and gave up trying to convince, no one believed. But he did try and think of why Zerg would be there. He shook his head and closed his eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The scouts grouped and disappeared into space. 3 were gone out of them, and two wraiths from the Terran.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Kerrigan</b> came out of the hidden distance and up on an elevated hill.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You come to die?" Kerrigan asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Are all of you this stupid? These are our mineral fields, take your organic asses away from my line of sight vermon!" Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It's the minerals you want?" Kerrigan asked. "Ha, we will be leaving shortly."
            </p>
            <p>
                "It isn't that easy," Narta said to himself.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What do you have up your sleeve now?" Tutos said in an irritated voice.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Nothing. We have what we want and you have what you want," Kerrigan said. "It's like you Tutos, to always want more. Just be glad we're keeping you alive.
            </p>
            <p>
                "So you are allied with a new race now? How lovely," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh I'm sorry. Curan, meet the Terran," Kerrigan said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Uh, that's nice, bye, or we'll force you to leave with a snap of my fingers a dozen wraiths will come out here and easily sweep the floor with you," Tutos said. Kerrigan smiled.

                Estolav walked over to Uran's office, where Uran sat, and sat down.
            </p>
            <p>
                "So you know about the Zerg down there?" Estolav asked. Uran bit his tongue.

                "Now what? Kerrigan obviously has something she's hiding from us. Another one of her little games."
            </p>
            <p>
                "We wait, wait until she does something. I have two motion trackers on her overlord as we speak. urther discuss this with General Tutos private, he knows far more than I do."

                "I went along with the others here to know what it is you don't want us to have," Astanlov said. Astanlov and Estolav went to the same battle accademy but Estolav was 40 years younger and half a dozen rankes lower and 20 divisions lower.

            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, she has something. Perhaps something from the depths of the mineral feilds," the representative from the federation said.

                Estolav walked down the hall again, away from the main common room, and put up his hood. The dropships were back, 8 were empty. As the airlock entrances opened, Arkanine existed first along with with medics and firebats behind him. Then two more, then 8 more opened. Marines with ripped armor, one arm, broken visors, started to come out. Tutos' wound was banaged up. Corseal came out. But after everyone came out there was no sign of Narta.
            </p>

                "No sir!" the marine answered, and made his way to the academy. Tutos looked down. "Maybe he's dead," he tought. Missing in action. Tutos slowly made his way to the academy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Estolav followed Tutos after hearing that the Zerg was invovled, he felt terrible having said those things to ttuoso. But then he stopped. Tutos had inprizoned him and would probably do so again if he saw him, but Estolav knew he could hide forever. Someone loyal to Tutos would see him and he'd know the hard way, and the bad way for Estolav. He jogged up to Tutos and kept pace with him.
            </p>
            <p>
                "However you say a military apology, that's what I'm trying to tell you now," Estolav said. Tutos stopped, and then so did Estolav.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No need to wear the robe, I know Narta got you out, but now he's dead. Just to inform you, keep you up to date, we are in a deep threshold of war, and there's no breaking out. Kerrigan knows or has something she stole from our mines. We have the mines but Kerrigan and her new race ally has us on a mental leash, and we're waiting to hear what happens next," Tutos said, and continued walking. Would war eer come to an end? Or would war come to an end, and just be a puse, and start up again. Estolav thought hard and then held his dog tags tight with his hand. Then paced to Uran's office. Uran sat looking through files.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm done," Estolav said. "I'm done with all of this stupid war bull shit, and all of this who has what, and it's all crap! You go and fight the Zerg, killing each other off, while I relax on a planet that knows nothing of any of this, just people who live lives in peace, and not of death and burial." Estolav ended and took a deep breath.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay, it's your life," and like that, poof, he was gone.

            <p>
                Battle cruiser Alpha was orbiting Alsays, and a base was established around the mines. On Alpha, Tutos sat in the common room overlookin th navigation. Arkanine, Corseal and many others were down around the base patrolling, scouting and discovering. A carrier and 6 scouts also orbited the planet. Tutos wasn't ging to go into war, he was going to try one more thing. He was going to capture a Curan, or a Zerg unit, and use it to get the plans or device that Kerrigan had. It would take a lot of hard work and secrecy but, if it worked, it would be good. Both would result in war but the Terran would already have what they want, so it would be an easier way, and Tutos wanted to succeed with this opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tutos sat elevated on the second floor of the navigation/common room. There was at least 100 people in the common room. Communication, navigation (ship control) on the inside, and then five were on the five frontal lazer bays. Throughout the ship were also these workers but the common room contained the majority of them. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Tutos typed in the coordinates to the next turn, and they showed up on the nava computer. A small green dot appeared on radar. Tutos examined it.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Is it an enemy ship? he asked the computer.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's a shuttle, a refugee shuttle it appears," the computer said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hail it," Tutos said, and let out a breath of relief. He didn't want a battle now, his plans had just begun! The ship was hailed, the frequency was secure and stable.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What is your destination? This is General Tutos from the Terran Confederacy," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Alsays," a voice returned.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Sir, the ship's title does come out as a boarding party, should I lock them down?" the computer asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, I'll handle this," Tutos said, muffling the frequency. "Your ship shows up as a boarding party, are you aware of that?" Tutos asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, but we are a shuttle, we've ran into that problem a lot," the voice on the other end said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay, pull them in, get marines down there now, we'll see if what they see is true," Tutos said, again muffling the frequency.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Roger that," the computer joked. the shuttle on the radar was getting pulled in by the Alpha's tractor beam.
            </p>
            <p>
                A dozen marines, armored and suited up, ran down the hall to the docking bay. Inside defenses were up. Three twin auto cannons poppued up around the entrance. Soon, the shuttle floated in and the huge docking bay airlock doors closed. The ramp of the shuttle lowered. Pressure was released from the sides in a misty texture.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was the sound of metal on metal, a rifle dragged down the ramp way as the 12 marines and three twin auto-cannons pointed at the bottom of the ramp. Tutos walked into the large docking bay area with his side-arm. 
            </p>
            <p>
                "I think this is my stop," a human voice echoed off the walls. And <b>Cpt. Jim Raynor</b> stepped off the ramp. Rifles lowered.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Raynor, you scared me to death, I was expecting a 13 headed monster, but you give that a bad name!" Tutos called.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Nice to see ya!" Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Check the rest of the ship," Tutos ordered. The marines jogged up the ramp.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It's been too long, what, 8 years?" Tutos asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I think so. Let's not let that happen again," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I agree," Tutos said. "Come up to my office."
            </p>
            <p>
                Jimmy and Tutos walked up the stairs and made their way back.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the marines got the cockpit of Jimmy's ship, they saw 2 robots at the controls.
            </p>
            <p>
                "May I help you?" one asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Open the cargo area, we need to check what you're carrying," the squad leader said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "On my way," the machine said. It started punching in numbers and twisting knobs. The door to the cargo area opened. 2 dozen people sat and stood. There were no humans and 3/4 of th people were robed.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Please identify yourselves, starting with the front," the squad leader said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tutos and Jimmy entered a private office down hall 8.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well where were you all this time?" Tutos asked as they both sat down.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Doing some secret work at a few minor systems. I'll be happy to be transferred to your new base on Alsays if you need anyone," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We can always use you," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "So what are the current issues on you end?" Jimmy asked. Tutos folded his hands and took a deep breath.
            </p>
            <p>
                "About 3 months ago, when we established an assault on Alsays, the Zerg and Curan were there. We, or the majority of us, thoguht that the Protoss were using our mines, but hte Protoss were actually helping us and fighting the Zerg. Fire stopped and Kerrigan granted us the mines. Soon we figured out that she possessed an <b>orb</b>, an artifact she got from our mines," Tutos said. "Now I want to find out what it does, and all that." 
            </p>
            <p>
                Jimmy nodded. "What have tou decided to do, or have you decided yet?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, we have decided. I want to obatin a Zerg or a Curan, brainwash it, and use it to find our get that orb, whatever it is Kerrigan possesses," Tutos stated.
            </p>
            <p>
                "How certain are you that this is going to work?" Jimmy asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Not certain at all," Tutos answered, immediately and in the same tone of voice. He expected that question right when it had been brought out.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well, if you want, I'll surely help with that too," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm still planning it and talking it over with others, but I want this to stay within Terran ears," Tutos said. "Meaning, if Protoss or the federation find out that it holds great power or plans that can offer great power, they're going to want it," Tutos said. Jimmy nodded.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Understood," he stated.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Good," Tutos said. "Not that I think you will anyway, but just to make sure."
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                "I am from the Kazakian race, and am coming from the planet Armagard," said a tall beast-like creature.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You're cleared," the squad leader said and stepped parallel to the next row.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were two people with robes and a hood covering their face.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Remove your hood and identify yourself," the marine said. There was no response.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hey!" the squad leader said. And in a split second, th robed figure got up and slit the marine's throught. The squad leader fell back, gargling on his own blood. the other two marines behind him pointed their rifles at the person and shot. The figure jumped up onto the wall, took out two blades from his vest, and threw them at the two marines. The blades went into the marines armor and into their chests. Two more robed men got up and took two blades from their vests. The other marines heard the comotion and walked into the cargo room. Two of the robed men sandwiched one and put blades through both sides of his neck. The other marines took the opportunity and shot. One of the robed figures took several bullets in his chest and fell down. The cargo doors closed and the marine was stuck in there. He shot at the robed figures knowing his life was at an end anyway. He missed for the better half of 30 shots, but 4 hit the robed figure. The other came off the wall and clawed the marine's head clear off. Six more came from the shadow.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Take us out," the leader said. It was a deap and beast like voice.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes sir," the machine answered. The Kazakian was shocked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What the—" but befeore he could finish, the leader of the robed figures put a blade into the top of his head. He fell silent. The shuttle's engines started and the Terrna's computers were partly jammed by the other (co-pilot) machine. The docking bay doors opened. The twin auto-cannons fired but the shuttle got away. It flew down to the planet Alsays as fast as it could.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The shuttle is gone!" a navigation system control person told Tutos in the doorway.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What? How...alert the surface!" Tutos frantically ordered. Jimmy stood.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm going down there," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Find out what they are and leave one alive!" Tutos yelled as Jimmy ran out the door.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tutos buried his face in his hands and started to breathe heavy. This was not in his plans, deffidently none of this was in his plans.

            <p>
                Jimmy boarded a dropship, not waiting for anyone. Not even a pilot was aboard but he knew how to fly. He turned on the engines and flew out of the docking bay. He kept accelerating until he was at the atmosphere. His hanger hit the top of its limit, and the top of the container just came off. One hand was on the navigation pannel, the other hand was closed in a fist, and he felt like if he looked in the mirror, he was more red than a watermelon. The dropship started to shake.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Approaching dangerous speed, approaching dangerous speed," the computer repeated. With his clenched fist, Jimmy punched the screen, and the sound disappeared. Jimmy loaded his rifle and desert eagle sidearm when the dropship reacehd 300 mph and kept dropping. He was a mile from the surface. He set it on and autopilot landing cycle and walked into the cargo hold. He suited up with another belt of grenades and knives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Soon the dropship landed and Jimmy ran down the ramp. He looked around. Miles of field in every direction. He ran back up and ramp and back into the cockpit. He hit the accelerator. The dropship flew 40 mph 20 feet off the ground. Kimmy looked out the side window. Over the horizon he was saw the Terran base, it was at least 2 miles away. He sped up and continued.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I've spotted the base Tutos," Jimy said, and took a deep breath, letting out his anger. The dropship floated and kept flying in a straight line. then, half a mile from the base, the dropship's systems shut down from an EMP missile from somewhere. Jimmy couldn't control it, it took a noise dive and boom, and explosion cracked the ground the dropship broke in half, the back half engulfing in flames. The front half's glass was long passed shattered and half the siz.
            </p>
            <p>
                Four figures in black robes came over the hill with claws allready out.
            </p>
            <p>
                A metal piece of rubbel had knocked Jimmy over but he had gotten up. He had his rifle out in front of him and was ready to unleash hot fury. But no one came into view. He took a few steps forward. He heard footsteps to his right and he glanced, and to his left a foot hit his visor and knocked him back. He threw his arms around whil running and tackled the robed man down into the metal flooring and gripped his neck. The other three made their way in and pryed Jimmy off their comrade and started to kick him. Then elbow him and knee him. Jimmy was getting killed. When death approached him the ground rumbled. The robed men fled and ran. Jimmy looked up. A mech came into view. It was code named goliath in the Terran ranks. Jimmy got up.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What are you doing without a squad Raynor?" the goliath asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Came down here in a bit of a hurry," Jimmy answered.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Come on, base is only half a mile away," the goliath said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, do you know what they are?" Jimmy asked, looking at the single file trail.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Not yet, we do have a blood sample," the goliath said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Good, let's go, and see who these people are, and then hope that I'm calmed down," Jimmy said, and quickly made it back with the goliath. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The defenses were fair but the orientation was excellent. The goliath drifted off. Jimmy was greted by two marines. Soon, they escorted him off view of the entrance. The base was farelly small so far, one barracks, a bunker, an armory, and a command center. Jimmy kept on a path toward the command center. The mineral field went far back as the eye could see. Marines roamed through them, patrolling. The mineral patches were about 12-15 feet tall. If anyone got in, it would be a maze.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Jimmy got to the command center door, a red light constantly blinked. A keypad popped down with a small screen, numbers, and letters. He punched in a dozen numbers and 2 dozen letters. He waited, the blinking red turned blinking green and there was a click. To start, it was a ten foot hallway. A gated metal flooring with piped and wired cealings and walls. His rifle was firmly by his side as he walked. His pistol sat in his built in holster on his waist down his thigh. As the hall came to an end there was another door, with a camera and red blinkng lights.

                    On Zerg controlled planet Char, Kerrigan sat in the main hive cluster loving glory. She loves watching the Terran and Protoss go frantic while her treasure lay safely on Alsays planet. Over 1 billion people, beasts, were on Char. Kerrigan was confident she was safe along with her artifact. A dozen hunter killers slid around the hive and a few were inside, heads low, bowing to her.

            <p>
                Jimmy finally got to the common room. Marines blended into the wall texture and color. The center of the common room had a crystal and several orbs flying around it, enriching it and keeping the crystal thorough.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hmm, I don't even want to ask what you've been up to," Jimmy said aloud. A door from the opposite end opened and Arkanine, Corseal, and a few other men walked in.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well speak of the devil," Arkanine said. Jimmy made his way around the crystal.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I cam down to assist you animals. But before I could land my ship got shot down," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yeah, Curan are all over these lands. Watch your back, don't fly low," Arkanine said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'll remember that for next time, if I make it out of here," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Nice to meet you Jim Raynor, I heard a lot about you," Corseal said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Good, I hope," Jimmy said. Corseal laughed and gave away a slight nod. The crystal was bright. "We can use this crystal for..." Jimmy intended to ask a question.
            </p>
            <p>
                "To join power with whatever Kerrigan has, and locate it," Arkanine said.

                "Interesting," Jimmy examined the crystal.
            </p>
            <p>
                "With every hero there is a villin, and we seem to have the hero, that soon might turn into a villin," Corseal said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Very intresting," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What are we going to do about these Curan that are roaming so close to our priceless possession?" Jimmy asked with a smile.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Expand our perimeter with greater defenses and soon, seend out scouting parties, expedition parties, etc." Corseal said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'd like that," Jimmy grinned.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We are getting a party together now," Corseal said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You can be the squad leader of that, along with a squad of marines," Corseal said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You depart in an houru, the marines are in the armory now," Corseal said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I need some food," Jimmy groaned.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We have a kart in the barracksm" Corseal said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'll be back," Jimmy said, and made his way to the barracks.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Tutos sat in his chair in the cockpit of Alpha and did his job that he has for the last month. Looking over the navigational common room. Men sat at their stations, receiving minor hails, repairing small fires, etc.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Jimmy wolfed down the food that was in a bowl. At the end his hands were full of sauce and slivers of the oatmeal like texture of the food. He got up, wiped his hands on the towel and made his way back to the courtyard. The courtyard consisted of the shape the buildings formed around. There was a bunker in the dead center. Jimmy waited, soon he spotted 12 marines. Corseal was in front.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Here are the coordinates in which you should go, and the way where I and all of us want cleared," Corseal said and handed Jimmy a computer pad the size of his hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay, it looks like we'll be back at sun-down, if we're not, we're dead," Jimmy said simply. "And I want a vulture prepared for me when I get back, clear?" Jimmy layed out his expectations of them, and Corseal nodded.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Don't worry about a thing," Corseal vowed, as the squad departed on foot. Jimmy led them, and the marines rotated themselves around while walking. Soon, the sight of the base was gone and all they had was each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                "First coordinate is by that tree!" a marine yelled. They jogged cautiously and secured the area.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay, area one secured, let's proceed," Jimmy said, and the marines were off.
            </p>
            <p>
                They pointed their rifles in different directions. Every bit of sound received a gun barrel in its direction. They could easily be ambushed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Curan outnumbered the Terran nearly 4:1. The odds were poor, so Jimmy and his squad were extra careful. They kept walking.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Coming up on second coordinate, a half mile away or so, engage 3 degrees north, we're getting off track," the marine said. Jimmy looked at the coordinate monitor and moved while looking. Then he caught something up ahead. Black robes. He didn't like them.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay, take it slow, watch yourselves," Jimmy said calmly. He got a bit lower and launched his rifle up in the air and clutched his sidearm firmly. The others did the same. Approaching the hill, Jimmy and his squad took deep breaths. Then as they made it over the hill, six robed things stood.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You are entering Curan grounds, step away now," the one in the middle said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, I'm aware of the fact that this is Terran land," Jimmy stated.
            </p>
            <p>
                "This is your last warning, step back now or die," the leader said. Jimmy stroked his rifle.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Four on 13, hmmm, you're in a tight spoto here I believe, and oh no, you don't have any long range, and you're 10 feet down the hill," Jimmy said. The leader smiled. The two middle robed men dove at the marines. The reaction time was slow when one of the robed men put a spiked weapon into a marine's armor. Jimmy shot but the other jumped again, kicking the rifle out of his hand. The lader stroked the grass and rolled, rifle shots pierced the grass next to him and as he landed he threw a long dagger like weapon. The marine turned, dodging the dagger. Jimmy uppercutted the one next to him, sending him to the ground. His rifle was nowhere in sight. He pulled the desert eagle from his belt and lined up the sight with a distant robed figure and pulled the trigger. The figure fell. Jimmy then turned, receiving a blow across the visor from the leader.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other two robed men took a marine out by clawing him with their weapons. Jimmy through his feet around and nailed the leader twice. Then he rolld to the side, raised his desert eagle and shot the leader once in the head. The blood was red. Jimmy turned, seeing another one of his comrades dead. He had 2 shots left in his clip. He used the bullets sparingly hitting one of the robed men on the ground, his legs throbbing out blood. The other sliced a rifle in half and kicked a marine back. Jimmy reloaded. But it didn't matter, two marines flanked the invader an shot him a dozen times through the back. He dropped to his knees.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I want a blood sample," Jimmy said, and pulled the hood off one. The last one moaned as he moved with his arms. Jimmy bent down, put the barrel of his desert eagle against the crawling enemy, and sot into his back. The robed figure fell flat and silent.
            </p>
            <p>
                "They're deffidently Curan," one marine said, as he and another checked the puls of the two marines that lay silent on the grass.
            </p>
            <p>
                "They're gone," the marine said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Down that way is obviously a Curan settlement, or more than we think. With my luck, it is more than we think!" Jimmy ended and found his rifle hidden beneath the tall grass.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Let's proceed before more come," Jimmy said. The 10 remaining marines followed Jimmy. He held the monitor at his waist, glancing at it every few minutes. It was also radar within 20 ft. so nothing could eeasily sneak up on them. There were miled of trees coming up.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Stay close," Jimmy said as they approached the forest.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Tutos feelt his forehead and then popped two painkillers in his mouth. He was at the age where he started to feel old. Not actually old, but just feel old. His hair was still brown but his mind was going unclear. He felt bad about every order he gave for the past 2 years. Whatever the order, he felt bad about enforcing it.
            </p>
            <p>
                When he was a first star general in his mid 30's, it all came to him, all the answers and resolutions to everything were in his mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                He coughed and lay back in his chair.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Jimmy and his squad reached the treeline when they heard plants move. The sound was getting softer.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Chase whatever's running!" Jimmy yelled. They all started to chase the reliance on their ears. The forest was thick and blocked out all light. Jimmy was losing it. He pushed himself to move faster. The other mairnes were a few yards behind him and they kept running. Finally, the ground felt heavy.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Approaching a cliff," Jimmy said, out of breath. He spread his arms out, blocking the marines from running off. A squirrel pranced along the side of the cliff, nibbling at the edges.
            </p>
            <p>
                "False alarm," Jimmy said, and just then three beasts were there! Curan soldiers, their gel armor slurped around and their long claw weapons firmly attached to their hands. Jimmy couldn't step back, he reached down and pulled out a white piece of cloth.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Smart choice," one of the Curan said in a deep and scratchy voice. "Give me your guns," the same one said, shortly after his previous statement. The marines gave up their pistols and rifles but Jimmy kept his pistol sfely in his left armored patch. Then Jimmy and the marines lifted their hands in the air and stood silent.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Come with us, our leader wants to see you," the one in the middle said. The marines unhappily followed the three Curan, who had their weapons in a firm grip within their hands. Two more came in back of the marines and to the sides. They were always one step ahead of the Terran. Whatever they did, the Zerg or Curan countered it with little or no problem. Jimmy thought long and hard, but each thought drove to a dead end. After miles of walking Jimmy, half asleep, stepped on a sticky gel material. The marines could barely walk through it. The curan walked on it like it was terrain known to the humans. One of the Curan soldiers pushed Jimmy forward, speeding him up. Jimmy just gave the beast a nasty look and continued on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, some illustration of buildings were painted amongst the humans' eyes. They looked more advanced than Zerg buildings. They were also far from organic. They were like energy blots and zipping orbs. It was al ot like the power that dwelled in the crystal back in the Terran base. Thinking back, Jimmy lost all hope when he saw the sun sink beneat the thick blankets of the sky. He still had his gun though, andi f he lost that, he was sure they were all dead. The 7 Curan soldiers brought the 11 humans into a ball of energy. It was bright and worked as a transporter. It was actually a lot like Zyphlin technology. That made Jimmy's mind switch over to that topic. Curan couldn't have that intelligence, they couldn't have, they were formred by genetics from Zerg DNA, and the erg aren't the smartest of creatures. They all arrived in an energy filled common room with 6 Curan guards and a tube in the center. The humans' focus was on the tube, waiting for something to happen.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nothing did happen until they were forced up against the wall. The cryo tube opened, sending light everywhere. An outline of a 6 foot 6 inch creature stepped out of the tube. It was Curan, with a different face, more like Protoss, but deffidently, disstinctively Curan. He walked down the 2 foot ramp and onto the same floor that the humans feet encroached on. He paced, looking at each one of the marine's faces and stopped near Jimmy.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well well, the human hero Raynor, how pretty," the Curan leader said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hello Cyan, at least I don't hide in a tube for protection and come out lookin' all strong," Jimmy said, and rested his head against the wall.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm not the one who almost walked off a cliff and is here in captivity now," Cyan said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hmmm," Jimmy said quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I want you to tell your people to stay off our land. We haven't attacked your colony yet, now you pay the price. It only takes one to deliver a message and it's not going to be you," Cyan said, and stepped closer to Jimmy.
            </p>
            <p>
                "That's comforting," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well, I hope you think the way we kill you isn't a bad way," Cyan said. Two guards approached Jimmy.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The same to you," and at that moment, a huge gunshot sound went off and the bullet from Jimmy's desert eagle tore through Cyan's gut. He moaned.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Get your weapons!" Jimmy yelled to his marines. The marines scattered, knocking over Curan as they went. Jimmy shot at the Curan soliders, aiming at where limbs join the rest of the body frame. A marine was hacked up right where he picked up his rifle from the ground. Jimmy reloaded and shot a soldier in the head, saving a marine's life.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We're outnumbered, let's get out of here!" Jimmy yelled. His feet seemed like they hovered across the floor. Another marine went down in the midst of jogging out. Jimmy and eight marines slowly made it across the sticky surface when a laazer hit the back of a marine's neck. The marine fell into the gel surface and half-sunk through.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jimmy and his squad ran free of sight. They ran for miles, and then collapsed! Jimmy's heart was a stead beat and his mind was dizzy. He couldn' even move his fingers, his 3 mile run with a full suit on got in the way. He closed his eyes and fell into a dreadfull and alert sleep. It was a stupid idea but none of them could help it. The sky was a dark blue with no sun, but still not dark. The starts began to smile through the sky.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Tutos' eye fell on a woman he had never seen before. She was a medic, or so it seemed. She had blonde hair (dirty blonde) and she walked to a desk and sat down.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hmm, high ranked," Tutos said. He smiled at himself. She looked in her 20's. The common joke was that General Tutos "couldn't count that high" and that gave most people who wanted to know the idea. He looked back at his work and gave himself another smile, and a chuckle that promoted another cough. He shook his head. The woman looked over at him but it was just a glance. "Just a glance".
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Jimmy and his marines awoke. They were all in the back room of the academy. The "medic room".
            </p>
            <p>
                Jimmy sat on a bed, he had a huge cut across his rib that he hadn't felt in battle. It was at least a foot long, but luckily for him not too deep. That was just about the best looking injury out of the rest of the six marines. One had a finger missing and another's leg was gone. Then two marine's had several cuts like Jimmy's one. The deaths were sad, but now they knew the exact coordinate to where the Curan's base was. Even though the monitor was broken, he remembered it. A-17, 043, BBC, R1716157. Farely simple but Jimmy wrote it down anyway. A medic walked in.
            </p>
            <p>
                "How are you feelin' Cpt. Raynor?" the medic asked and sat down in a stool next to the bed.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Considering..." he started. the medic took the old bandage off Jimmy's cut and secured a new one on again.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Don't let me stay in here for too much longer, I can't get the ugly thoughts out of my head trying to reason with the Curan. I guess my gun'll have to help."
            </p>

            <p>
                Corseal and Arkanine, along with the confederate council, sat around a small table.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Somehow I feel as if we're going around in circles," Corseal said before the council was ready for an intellectual response.
            </p>   
            <p>
                "Before we kill, or whatever word you want to use for the meaning irradicate, we have to know exactly what we're dealing with and how we're oging to approach the situation," <b>President Donda Lee</b> said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Aren't we there, I feel like we've been there for the past 6 years," said Corseal.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Not even close! If you only knew how much planning and thought goes into an operation like this," the President said again.
            </p>
            <p>
                "So tell me President Lee, six more men, soldiers, people of our brotherhood died in a scouting mission. Another six injured along with Jim Raynr. They were captured and then escaped. If Raynor wasn't there they'd all be dead. It was also safe, we took the greatest percaussions ever on this scouting expedition. Until our men stop ding, I am close to positive I will stick to what I think," Corseal ended and continued stiffening in the leather chair. "I believe I speak for Colonel Arkanine when I say this," Corseal said and finished.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I also feel bad for the losses we've experienced over the past 5 years, 10 years, but we have to retrieve what Kerrian has. The death of men is out of my hands," Lee said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Arkanine spoke. "Yes I do agree with Corseal in ithe respect that men are dying, but we do have to get the treasure that Kerrigan has. It can wield the power of things greater than those we ever read when we were young. Things are bad, I agree, but they can get a whole lot wore," Arkanine said. Lee nodded.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes," Lee said. The other council members nodded.
            </p>
            <p>
                "So what we have to do is simple, hopefully by the scouting party, we know the Curan base's weaknesses and in turn, take them out with our grand assault fleet," Lee said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I doubt the Protoss or Kar'Athak will give us any battle support, but they might help behind the scenes with some tactics," Lee stated.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, but with my experience with the Kar'Athak, they can't be trusted. Even if they are helping us with tactics, we are better off without them, or even alone for that madder," <b>Admiral Canclave</b> suggested.
            </p>
            <p>
                "As much as I would want to ban them from our plan, we need help, reguardless of our thoughts. This is no joke. It's not a game either, we should treat it as if it were the most important thing to us all. I know for the past two weekds I've had 10 hours of sleep," Corseal said. Arkanine cleared his throat.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Order 8-10 representatives from the Federation, Protoss, and Kar'Athak, and tell them to dock at battle cruiser Alpha," Lee said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We shall finish this up in the air, the council, me, you, Arkanine, General Tutos, and his Exo," Lee said and shuffled up his papers.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Get yourselves up there in the next 24 hours," Lee said. It was true that Kar'Athak couldn't be trusted but, to win, they had to take the risk.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Tutos stood looking straight through the common room window. He saw a cluster of stars gone. Something was blocking the view, black cruisers.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Two Kar'Athak cruisers," a navigation pilot said.

                "Accept the hail," Tutos ordered.
            </p>
            <p>
                "There's two boarding parties. Don't worry it's safe, even Silister is in one of them," the pilot said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay, let's meet'em," Tutos said. "Be ready, just in case, you know," Tutos said, his voice echoed off the walls. As he walked down the hall, two more marines followed him. He stopped in his office, his comlink was blinking. He turned the knob.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We need a dropship. Jimmy's alive but he got shot down and then captured. He's back here now but we need a dropship for me, Colonel Arkanine, and the confederate council," Corseal's voice laked through the tabletop comlink.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay, I'll do that, but the Kar'Athak reprsentatives are here, on Alpha, so a dropship will be on its way," Tutos explained. He typed in the order to the docking bay for the dropship to pick the men up on Alsays. The marines stood at the doorway with their sidearms safely tucked in their utlity belts. They made their way, Tutos leading down the hall to the docking bay. As they entered, the two Kar'Athak boarding ships set down on the surface and released pressure. It was also in a mist like liquid gas. The ramp lowered. Men in black robes and black suits with small advanced goggles over their eyes walked over to the stairs, up to the hall and into a meeting room following Tutos. A dropshift left Alpha and was on its way to pick up the other members of the meeting. <b>Silister</b> the <b>Kar'Athak Lord</b>, walked with his colleagues and sat at the table. Anybody that wasn't Kar'Athak didn't know which one was Silister.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The Protoss will be here soon along with some of my men, but int he mean time let's talk turkey. Obviously you're not helping us willingly, so how much money is it going to take for you to help us? Huh?" Tutos asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "At least 22 million mesas per squad, so it will cost you quite a bit," one of the Kar'Athak said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "22 million..." Tutos' voice faded. "We just can't afford that, maybe 15 million per 2 squads, 7.5 million a squad but the last time I checked you're not mercenaries," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We aren't crazy about helping you and, if we do, we want something in it for us," a different Kara'Thak said. Tutos gasped.
            </p>
            <p>
                "15 mill a squad?" Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "20."
            </p>
            <p>
                "15."
            </p>
            <p>
                "17."
            </p>
            <p>
                "15."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Deal. But if anything happens you know what will happen," a Kar'Athak said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I hope you don't mean that to be a threat," Tutos said. The Kar'Athak sat silent.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay, 15 million mesas, I'll contact you when we're making our move," Tutos said. The Kar'Athak left quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                "They can't be trusted," a marine said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It doesnt matter," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: lucida sands unicode; color: grey;">
                <i>(October 1st, 2002)</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                "I know but once we find the treasure they're gonna fight for it," the marine said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I know, that's when plans come into use," Tutos said and plucked his lip.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes sir. I'll be at the academy if you need me," the marine said. Tutos nodded.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Canclave, Arkanine, Corseal, President Lee, and the rest of the council boarded the dropship. The Protoss were called off, the meeting came to an abrupt end with the Kar'Athak and then Terran knew that the Protoss wouldn't charge them. No pun intended. The Kara'Thak were playing a trap on them, but it wouldn't work. Tutos was one of these people who thought ahead. He knew what would counter whatever they had in mind. Tutos had gotten less kustoppo and more thought over the past five years. He thought of what was going to come. He hoped the defenses improved down at the base of Alsays. If they got taken out, the Terran rac would be done. Tutos gasped, got his mind back on his job, and sat there waiting for his colleagues to arrive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, the comlink on his desk lit up. He got his posture straightened and his thoughts cleared.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Major Corseal is here General," a voice sobbed through the comlink, as if he had better things to do, and he did. Everyone on Alpha did. Even though their lives were devoted to their race, the same devotion was bad. Everyone except for medics and workers on shift worked 20 hours a day, tactical advice, working out minor issus. Meetings, debates, battling, and all of those things led to anxiety, stress, and most of all insanity. Tutos, after 30 years in the military, felt it was too much. Hundreds of thousands of hours were put into building, remodeling, etc. and he did make a difference, but 150,000,000 people worked in the military in some way. The only true civillian lived on a planet called <b>Farline</b>. About 15 million in a large planet. Terran airofrce and ground security roamed the skies and surfaces, but if that were ever to be raided there was a good hance that it would be destroyed and, soon after that, under the control of another race that dwells power. The door opened.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm surprised you made it," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Me too, black ships just flew past us," Corseal said. Tutos shifted around, scared to death.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Just kidding, the Kar'Athak ships went the other way and we're monitoring them with the dropship's power," Corseal joked as he, Arkanine and the council found seats around the table. President Lee sat somewhat in the middle, across from the Tutos.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Sorry you missed the polite Kar'Athaks, but they wanted 22 million mesas for each squad," Tutos said. The eyes of all the men widened and shifted towards Tutos.
            </p>
            <p>
                "But I bargained it to 15 mill, we need their help," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "But, but 15 milion, we have only the money to spare 40 million, we will not be getting more than 30 soldiers for their help," Corseal said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, I know," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I figured we use the money on the Kara'Thak and hope they don't turn on us," Tutos said, sounding drunk.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Right," Canclave said. "But the Kar'Athak wouldn't dare turn on us, we should trust them." The council members nodded. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Lee then spoke. "So we should contact the Protoss and coordinate the forward to Char," Lee said gruesomely. The rest of the people smiled.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Go into Char and wipe everything out? I don't think you know how much support and tactics are just floating through that planet. And how you said it, it sounded like we could just go in there guns blazing. And we can't, not even with Protoss help. Or 2 or 3 squads of Kar'Athak," Corseal said. "The Zerg and Curan forces ae a billion, our forces and the Protoss forces are about 350 million. I'm telling you, we can't invade Char, we have to eliminate the Curan threat on Alsays before we do anything else. We should coordinate the forward there, not Char," Corseal continued.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was silence except for the shuffling of paper and swiveling of chairs.
            </p>
            <p>
                President Lee looked at Tutos, straight in the eye.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Where's Captain Uran?" Lee asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Farline," Tutos answered.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'll contact him, and then contact you with his decision, thoughts, plans, everything," President Lee said. 
            </p>
            <p>
                "If you don't mind, we'll send a marine along the way with you, for our sake," Tutos said. Lee nodded of course.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Sure," he followed up with.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well, it's settled then, I'll contact the Protoss and we'll coordinate the attack on the invaders of Alsays," Lee said ironically. The Terran were the previous invaders, but it was for the cause of their race.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Jimmy rolled out of the hard bed and onto a harder and colder floor. He coughed and got to his knees. He pulled his dogtags from the end table and quickly put them over his head. He clutched his sidearm and leaned against the side panel of his bed. He started to breathe heavy and stumbled to his feet. The room was about 20 by 20. His fellow marines were still there. Some looked dead, some were looking at him.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Don't let me die," one said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You won't," Jimmy said. The marine was breathing through a tube and couldn't move any part of his body. Jimmy walked out of the room and into the academy. A medic stood there.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Feeling better?" she asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Much, thanks, but now I have to go back in there, with or without anyone. Preferably with someone, or two, but people died under my decisions and that can't happen again," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, you can't, I heard they are already planning something. Thousands will come and many will die. That's just it. It's battle, people die," the medic said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I know about war, I've been in the military for almost fifteen years, since I was fifteen I fought. Somehow losses are too potent against us. Especially at this point in time," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Just wait, it should be coordinated and all ready in 10 days or so. The council is setting up a voting counter about what we should do. People on Farline will be able to vote in the matter of hours," the medic said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "How do you know so much?" Jimmy asked her.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm curious," the medic said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh yeah, well get back to work," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "If you stay," the medic said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, I will stay. Now get back to work," Jimmy said. The medic smiled and turned. Jimmy looked up through the sky light window and saw a bunch of black dots. Wraiths... Jimmy wondered what wraiths were doing there. He walked down the hall and into the room titled "We ar", short for weapons and armor. He grabbed a rifle and a full suit of armor and suited up.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Tutos looked at his bland comlink that sat a mystery on the table. He awaited the statement of the "go ahead", where he would tell his marines to board the dropships and immediately get down to Alsays. He put his mouth up to the MC2 phone and spoke the words that ordered the marines.
            </p>
            <p>
                "All units suit up and wait for my call to board the dropships," Tutos spoke.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jimmy walked outside the academy as the wraiths landed in the courtyard. Cpt. Orno stepped out of one.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well, Jim Raynor, good luck on the ground assault," Orno said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What?" Jimmy asked, as if he didn't hear Orno.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, nobody told you? You are leading the ground assault to the Curan base," Orno said. Jimmy gasped.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yeah I knew that," Jimmy lied, and smiled as if he was joking.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Good, you're responsible for squads 1-100." Th words froze Jimmy's mind. He was responsible for 1,200 men and women. He swallowed air, he was never responsible for that many and wasn't too sure he could handle it.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Just sit tight, we'll get the order to move in when the Protoss get here. then it's hammer time," Orno said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hail to that," Jimmy said. Orno smiled as the other companies got out.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We need weapons and fresh supplies," Orno said. "In case we have to use the escape pod, we need to be able to defend ourselves."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Tell someone in the academy, they'll help you," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay," Orno replied, he signaled to his men and followed them into the academy. Jimmy looked up as a battle-cruiser shadowed the base completely, flying at 1/2 mile long and 1/4 mile wide, it supplied a great shadow. It wasn't Alpha, Alpha and a dozen other battle-cruisers had just entered the atmospherea along with 50 or so dropships, twenty valkyries, and 100 wraiths. That was just the half of the fleet. The other half was around in Farline, in case of a counter strike, they were ready.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Entering Alsay's atmosphere now, General," a voice echoed through the comlink. "Also we are receiving a message from Artanis, and the leader of the dark templars along with PResident Lee and the council, they will be here shortly."
            </p>
            <p>
                Tutos stood, gathered his weapons and armor, and steadily walked to the off ramp on the port side of the battle-cruiser. 100 marines stood behind him as Alpha landed.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Once you reach the base, await in the courtyard," Tutos ordered aloud. The marines clapped once and secured their knives, greandes, sidearm, and rifle.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ramp lowered, they were about 1/4 mile from the base and happily walked the solemn distance with little worry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jimmy stood next to the bunker in the middle of the courtyard as marines shuffled in and assorted themselves amongst the space given. As more and more men came in, ARkanine and Corseal stood on the other side of the bunker. When Tutos entered, the marines formed a bath by each taking steps away from each ohter. 90 out of 100 marines that were following Tutos departed and found spaces, the other 10 found spaces around the bunker, acting as security. Firebats, goliaths, and tanks parked themselves around the marines and listened. Tutos climbed up on top of the bunker and kept his rifle to his side. Wraiths and battlecruisers patrolledthe skies, some landing. At that time, Cpt. Orno and his squad of wraith pilots walked out of the academy and stood straight and alert. At that time a marine handed General Tutos a small sound enlarger (microphone) and Tutos cleared his throat.

                <b>Chapter 8: First Strike</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                A wind blew by, cooling the men and women off from the beating sun that still sat comfortably in the clouds.
            </p>
            <p>
                "As we approach the time of battle, there are a few things that I would like to re-state," Tutos started and cleared his throat again. "We all have an end to our lives. But it is up to you how you want to meet that end. All of you can be something great, and if this mission succeeds, then so will all of us. We are fighting to retrieve back something that was stolen from our mines. Sarah Kerrigan didn't tell us what it is she had. She doesn't want to give it up either. So it is our duty as a race that deserves equalibreum with those around us, to get back, find and kill opposers who try to prevent us from finding this, this thing we know little of and want to know more about. We allready know that it is powerfull, and ours, and that informations is all I need to want it back." 
            </p>
            <p>
                The marines roared and cheered. Rifles stomped the ground and fists hit the air. When things started to settle down, Tutos spoke again.
            </p>
            <p>
                "To further inform you about the coordinate plan, Jimmy Raynor is the commander of squads 0-100, Captain Corseal is commander of squads 100-200, along with Colonel Arkanine. I'm fighting too, so don't sink your heads yet," Tutos said, and laughs exploded from the crowd.
            </p>
            <p>
                "President Lee, along with the council, will be overlooking this on Alpha, over the battle, he will be helping," Tutos said. "Now break into your squads and follow your commander's orders. I can't coordinate 5,000 men, now go, and succeed!" Tutos yelled. Marines, medics, firebats and a few tanks and goliaths followed Corseal and Arkanine and Jimmy down to separate paths. Jimmy's squads were going in the "back door", while Corseal and Arkanine's squads were in a larger number and therefore going in the front way. The plan was to pull the Curan to the front while Jimmy and his squads quickly find the orb and escape. Not necessarily quietly though...
            </p>
            <p>
                The marines following Jimmy treaded lightly on the tall grass.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hold position here," Jimmy said. The order reached all the marines (1,200 or so) through their comlink head-pieces. The marines stopped before the hill top and lay on their sides, awaiting there until further orders.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hold here for a moment until we get the signal that it's all clear, we wait, there could be Curan roaming all over and it only takes one to ruin our surprise attack," jimmy said and raised his rifle, pointing to the top of the hill.
            </p>
            <p>
                Corseal took our his signaler and pressed twice. Jimmy and his squads moved out over the hill and on.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Resdovous point with Protoss forces one also up ahead," Jimmy said. The sun began to sink below the clouds when footsteps bounced away.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Shhhh, hold position," Jimmy ordered. He llooked around seeing nothing. "Okay, slowly mvoe over the next hill." They did the order slowly. And over the hill thousands of Protoss stood straight.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before them, <b>Zeratul</b> stood, visible but the option to be suddenly "gone" was there.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm glad you could make it," Jimmy joked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The artifact lies beneath the cathedral, consuming all power and awaiting a master," Zeratul said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It's an artifact, that's good to know," Jimmy said. "Follow me, I'll do the hard work. After we get past most detectors, we could use you. Go under the cathedral and retrieve the artifcact"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I need support, I can't go into the depths of the cathedral alone, I'll be dead before I reach the second level," Zeratul said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'll have men with you before we get the defenses down," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Fair enough," Zeratul said. The next signal was made as Alpha's collosal flood-lights were in view.
            </p>
            <p>
                President Lee was in the view room with silence by his side. He saw out of the windows that were six feet tall and in a half-moon formation.
            </p>
            <p>
                A cigar was safely in between his teth and his hands gripped each other behind and below his belet. His view seemed level to the disappearing sun. He saw dark dots down on the durface as Alpha coasted a few hundred feet from the ground. A safe distance from needle spines, etc. That was why he was closely watching air radar, that was the only threat, and Curan had very little military air.
            </p>
            <p>
                He watched ass the dots came closer to the Curan base, which was 2 miles away. Alpha was going a very slow speed. About 20 mph! Alpha usually goes 200 mph in space, 300-500 mph in a pursuit out of warp speed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jimmy breathed heavy. The sunset brought immediate cold air. The rest of his team followed, kept following. The paths of Corsea's squads and Jimmy's squads kept pulling away. The base was in sight of a 100x zoomed in binocular pack. Even the wall was a lot more advanced than organic defenses. It was at least 25 feet high. Curan could easily clear that height by jumping it. Evn siege tanks would be there for hours trying to knock it down. Jimmy looked at his monitor. It showed the coordinates of a hidden gate. It was exactly where he wanted to go. As he approached 100 yard sof the outer back wall, he stopped and held up his hands. All the marines stopped.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The signal is gunfire," Jimmy said, and just then, the sound of several rifle shots shattered their ears.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Go! go! go!" Jimmy yelled. The marined fired at the fake wall that was used to hide the gate. It fell. They ran in, guns blazing. Curan soldiers came from alleyways and flanked the first few marines, scrapping them. Jimmy came in and shot the head of a soldier a few times, making it look like sloppy tissue. One jumped on his bck but got shot off rather quickly by another marine. Jimmy paced across the ground allowing more and more men to pour in. Meanwhile, Curan soldiers got the idea and 30 more came from alleys. Rifle shots pierced through flesh when the cathedral was in sight.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Let's get some defenses down," Jimmy said. 2 squads of firebats moved in with medics behind them. Curan units fighting Jimmy's units were gone and casualties were low. A blue passed Jimmy and toward the direction of the cathedral.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Squad 7, move in with Zeratul," Jimmy said. 8 marines, 4 firebats and a few medics followed closely to the blur.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Creatures that are in here are ones you would any think of in your worst of dreams," Zeratul said, and bent down to hisk nees. He tapped the stone and then felt the sides. "Oh good, no traps," he said. He tugged on a small handle and pulled it with a marine's help. It slowly gave up and was easily pulled after a few seconds. It scraped the dirt ground ad made a streaky line 3 feet across. It was dark, all they could see was dark...
            </p>
            <p>
                "Quietly," Zertaul simply said. Wraiths and scouts passed overhead shooting all they could for two seconds. That made a building burn, huge flames.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zeratul and the marines disappeared into the depths of the cathedral.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jimmy picked up a dead marine's rifle and emptied 200 rounds through a building, then dropped and reloaded the other. Corseal's squads were there as well. Then there were screams coming from the sky. The marines looked up, thousands of black dots. Finally, as they came lower to close to 1,000 feet, queens were in view.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Take cover!" Jimmy yelled. Marines jumped behind rubble, dove, just tried to get out of sight. In seconds, all queens fired. Marines all over turned to broodlings, little zerglings.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Zerg are here!" a marine yelled, right before he was hit by an orange wad, and split into two broodlings. It was a new ground assault, only the broodlings didn't get too far.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scouts and wraiths shot a few queens down when hundreds of mutalisks and scourges and devourers came.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cpt. Orno slowed down.
            </p>
            <p>
                "All units, get out of the facinity! It's suicide!" Orno yelled. Scouts and wraiths flew away leaving the marines hopeless.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Zerg ground! They must have dropped 'em!" a marine yelled. Hundreds of Zerg tampled in the base.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hold them off, we have to get that treasure!" Jimmy yelled and started to shoot down the Zerg. They kept coming in and the Terran were getting pushed back further and further.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Dropships, we need pickup now!" Jimmy yelled, but at that moment he had to duck, avoiding a zergling's blade. He stumbled back hitting the ground hard. The zerglings jumped up and roared. Jimmy calmly took a grenade off his belt and placed it in the zergling's mouth. Then he ran. The zergling exploded red blood trailing in a perfect circle of a 10 foot radius.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zeratul and the 14 soldiers heard nothing of it, communications went out when they went down into the cathedral.
            </p>
            <p>
                The marines had the lights at the end of their rifles turned on. The walls were mud and the roof leaked blood.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We should be running into a few Curan soon," Zeratul said and firmed the place of his blade. They moved on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jimmy walked a dozen packes and tackled a zergling, saving one of his men's life. The zergling thrashed around quickly and Jimmy fell off. He pulled his rifle out in front and along with a few marines shot it down. Then came the hydralisks. They were the ones that Terran really worried about. They spit needle spines that tear armor.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Here they come!" Jimmy yelled. They grouped up and got low. They rolled and shot, spines and bullets tore apart the other side. Jimmy jumped into a ple of rubble and formed a small bunker. A few more marines followed him in and pointed their barrels out of the small uneven margin.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Fire," Jimmy said and him and his colleagues fired.
            </p>
            <p>
                They started to push the Zerg back now. Marines who were out in the open were dying off quickly. Most had found cover one way or another behind rubble, mounted on piles, forming bunkers. The rubble wasn't as good as metal, it was energy/organic meterial that was a "giving" material and spines didn't get through. Jimmy and his men were in the safest position. There were at least a dozen layers of rubble/debris.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zeratul walked down a small ramp, getting light from the marines behind him. Then he heard a growl, and snap. There was a Curan in the light.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Don't fire, I have critical information for you," it said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Let's waste this mother—"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hold on, I trust him." Zeratul said. The marines were ready to blow it away though.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What you're hunting is not something you want to possess. It's a power consumer, a brainwasher, and a mind control all in one," it said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Shut up!" the same marine said. Then shot it once in the head, and it fell back.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No! He was giving good information!" Zeratul yelled. "You stupid Terran, you seek power rather than knowledge." Then looked back at the dead body.
            </p>
            <p>
                The hydralisks finally caught on to Jimmy's little bunker and tried to spit spines through the margin. Him and his marines ducked down. The spines hit the rubble behind them and put holes in it. Jimmy rolled out and ran to the other side while firing, hitting 10 different hydralisks but none of them died. He fell next to a pile of rubble where there were 6 un-injured marines, 2 medics and 9 goliaths. They all held position.
            </p>
            <p>
                "How did the Zerg get here so quickly? There aren't any settlements on this planet," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "That's what I want to know. How did they get here so fast, it's almost like they knew what we're going to do before we do it," a marine said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I think that's what it really is," Jimmy said. The marine thought.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Could be," the marine said stupidly, and the hill of the rubble was hit with enough force it blew over crushing the marine.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Ahh!" he yelled. He hit at the ground trying to move but he couldn't. He heard the ground shiver. All his allies were pushed back, only he was alive in the base, and he was sure not for long.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zeratul and the marineis got down to a large room and a chest was in the middle. Ancient writing (or so it looked it) was over the mud ceiling walls and flooring.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I have a bad feeling about this," the marine said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It's an ancient treasure. If we get within 10 feet of that chest, something will happen. Something big. So stay close. Follow me," Zeratul said. Zeratul and the marines slowly approached the chest.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Anything happpens, run out the way we came," Zeratul said. He clutched the handles of the chest. He breathed out, releasing pressure. Then the walls collapsed, dirt exploding through.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Out!" Zeratul yelled. Him and the marines started to run. The slow marine got smothered by the dirt and his visor shattered. He moaned but the dirt filled his lungs and killed him instantly. Another two marines lost speed and the same thing happened. The medic then got taken down. Zeratul's feet were contacting dirt when he tripped. The dirt smothered him and he was knocked around against the ground. The door was in sight when the last few men were taken by the dirt.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jimmy felt the dark shadow of the Zerg around him. His rifle was one foot out of range of his arms. His sidearm was still in his belt though. He saw movement in the alley.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Don't breahte!" a voice yelled and things, canisters, floated from the alleys. Smoke bombs. Jimmy didn't breathe. Even though his suit was supposed to filter out air that humans can't breathe and chemicals and smoke, he was hit in the armor by the neck which could have done something to the filter. They hydralisks backed away and Jimmy stood, got a baring of his surroundings and ran for one of the alley-ways. He still held his breath until he got a good 20 feet into the alley. That was when two men grabbed him. It was Corseal and Arkanine along with a few marines.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Where are the other 4,200 marines?" Jimmy asked agirly. 
            </p>
            <p>
                "Fighting off ground forces about a mile away. We got split up by massive Zerg," Arkanine said. "there is another squad in the alley across the way," Arkanine said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay, we have to find Zeratul," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Zeratul's dead, along with this damn mission. The Zerg set us up, they led us into this trap. We fell right into it," Corrseal said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Now, the last option is survival," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We have to get the treasure," Corseal said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, we have to get these men out of here!" Jimmy whispered loudly. Corseal looked down. "Now, there's got to be a wayout of this damn alley without them seeing us," Jimmy said. Just then the sky lit up and a wraith came soaring down in flames. It contained one of Orno's men. The wraith crashed between the two alleys and skid for a few seconds.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We're going to have to climb this wall," Jimmy said as he looked up and down the side of the structure. It had no handles, windowsills, just a flat surface.
            </p>
            <p>
                "How do you think we should do that," Corseal stated.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Strength," Jimmy answered.
            </p>
            <p>
                He led by example, took his fist and shoved it through the side. But it was more like a liquid than anything else. Jimmy looked down at Corseal and smiled. They started to climb. It came easy as they started. Then they heard the Zerg.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Smokes gone, let's hurry up," Jimmy said. They all hurried, hands and feet up the side. As Jimmy crawled onto the roof, he saw the air battle.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I never thought I'd be climbing energy," a marine's voice echoed off the liquidy walls. That gave them away. Two hydralisks came around the corner into the alley and looked up. They shot spines, nailing the legs of the marine.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Ah," the marine moaned, and his feet dangled. Arkanine grabbed him and pulled him up onto the roof.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Let's move," Jimmy said. They ran across the roof and jumped an eight foot gap to the next building. As they approached the edge of the last building, they saw the ground battle.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was a good distance away but they were sure it was the ground battle. There were constant flickers of light representing rifle shots, and the spines weren't seen in the darkness.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Let's find the treasure!" Corseal said. At that exact moment 12 dropships came down, away from the battle.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Order what's left of our forces onto those dropships private!" Corseal ordered.
            </p>
            <p>
                The marine jumped down taking a hard fall and ran as ffast and hard as he could to the scene. Jimmy and the others jumped too. In the distnace, an overwhelming concentration of dirt sa in the cathedral entrance.
            </p>
            <p>
                "They were ambushed by dirt in thehre. For all we know, the artifact is still in there," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Let's find it," Corseal said and started to dig with his hands. Just then it got quiet, too quiet. Shadows crept behind them as shivers quilled up the humans' backs.
            </p>
            <p>
                They turned and before they could get a shot off Jimmy was clawed across the chest. His armor cracked ope nand he fell back, knocked unconcious. Corseal pulled the trigger, he was in the back with Arkanine. The hydralisk in the front fell, and then they ran.
            </p>
            <p>
                Orno shot two gemini missiles at a queen running away. The back bled and it went into a nose dive and died. As the 12 dropships took off, Corseal and Arkanine barely made it. Glave shots, crossfire, etc. hit a few of the dropships and they exploded.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Go! GO!" Corseal yelled. The pilot was going 100 mph, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, they pulled out of the atmosphere with only one other following.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Damn!" Corseal yelled. They didn't have the treasure.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Rubble toppled on top of Jimmy and some rolled off. He was unconcious but his mind still knew the situation.
            </p>
            <p>
                No treasure and, by the end of the battle, probably 4,000 casualties. Nothing could stop death from being seen. It was all around everything, in everything, throughout everything. The host was war, infecting every being. Power was more than a desire, perhaps something everything was born to want. Every race except for one. It was looked at as a race with little threat but actually, they were so intelligent, they would support superior reason and tactics. They were known as the <b>Zyphlin</b> population. They were smart not to get involved, especially for a small number of people. It was unstoppable to hear about the treasure. It was now wanted by a half a dozen races. But the Zyphlin didn't even want to hear about it. They didn't want to walk into a trap...

            <p>
                Jimmy's eyes opened. He saw black all around him. He had pain everywhere and he lay in his own blood. Finally his eyes adjusted and he saw a small stream of light. He pulled himself across the ground with his hands. His legs felt heavy and scraped, gauged and bruised. He felt the side, gripping a shard of rubbled and pulled his legs up to it. He squished up to another, striving to reach the light. He was tired and reluctant to work but when he reached the light it was as if everything was fine. The warmth hit his hand. He pulled himself up through the rubble hole that he had to tug and squirm to get through.

            <p>
                His jaw dropped. There were bodies everywhere. The wind was quiet, the sun was up and was for a while. Jimmy crawled, the ground was coated with blood and the air smelt salty. There was a body every other step, most were Zerg but a lot were Terran. Jimmy felt like there was no hope left. That they had failed once and they did it again. This was until he saw a brown corner of something.
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: lucida sands unicode; color: grey;">
                <i>(October 4th, 2002)</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Hope was replenished instantly. He ran wildly to it, knelt down, and pulled it from its wedge in the rubble. It was the chest. It was the most lucky thing he's ever experienced. The looks were rusty and the chest was scratched up. He elbowed the lock harshly and it snapped. It wa the moment of truth. Jimmy quickly opened it. Smokey air came out. He looked away, and when looked back it was clear. The chest was stilled halfway with sand. One note was on top. He dug but found nothing. Maybe it was the wrong chest, but when he found a wrinkled up piece of paper, he knew he was at the one with the treasure. The paper said:
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>
                    That who opens this chest and takes this treasure will meet the power of it and will never be able to turn from it.
                </i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Jimmy was puzzled. He took the other note but there was nothing on it. He took the chest and the two piees of paper with him. He walked ot the main ground assualt area and looked around. Bodies as far as the eye could see. His comlink in his helmet was fried and there was a three foot gouge across his chest diagonally. He took his side arm from his belt and checked the ammo. It was full and he had tons of clips in his suit. Nothing living was around nothing at all.

            <p>
                Tutos and Corseal sat int he accademy while medics tended their wounds. Tutos had a cut on his leg and Corseal's hand was cut down but was still attached.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Send a dropship down, see if there are any survivors, and look hard, don't just pass by, and report back," Tutos said. 
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes sir," there was a firm voice and it left the academy.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Jimmy took deep breaths, his wound was getting to him. He fll to his knees. His vision was a blur, his eyes were rolled different ways and his mouth was dry. The back of his head was also bruised.
            </p>
            <p>
                He coughed and lay on the ground next to one of his dead comrades. He closed his eyes and relaxed himself.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the verge of death the ground held a slight vibration and the sky containeed one dot. Jimmy heard the sound echo through his mind but the acknowledgement was 0, his reaction was nothing as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dropship pilot circled the area going lower and lower. A marine sat, strapped ot a harness, with a pair of strong binoculars. All he saw were bodies and blood, and buildings.
            </p>
            <p>
                "First circle, no survivors, decreasing to to landing formation General," the pilot said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Follow your present course," Tutos said through the comlink. The dropship landed and two marines walked out.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh my God," one marine said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The bodies are enmormous. Split up, check everyone," the other said and secured his rifle to his leg. He rolled over a marine, it had 1/2 a head and guts were oozing out.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Holy shit," the marine stepped back. He took deep breaths.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jimmy heard the vague sound of them talking, but the voices still echoed through his head and tore into his heart. He tried to main but the blood was throughout his body and the cut in his chest stung in the wind. He couldn't move, all he could do was open and close his eyes. He felt one of them coming closer. He tried to be seen when he opened his eyes. The marine saw him.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh crap, it's Jim Raynor, he's wounded badly," the marine said into his comlink. "I need immediate medic assistnace," the marine said again. Jimmy still clutched the two notes and the chest was gripped rather loosely in his other hand. Finally he got a word out.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Help me," he said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "we are Jim, just keep breathing," the marine said. A medic slid over to them from the dropship and knelt next to Jimmy. IT was the same one he mete at the academy.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It's you," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                The marine pulled the chest and the two notes from Jimmy's hands and set them aside.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Make sure these get to General Tutos," Jimmy mumbled and lay his head back again.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes Captain," the marine said, and set the items in the cargo area of the dropship. The medic took out a bottle of clear liquid and poured a small amount throughout his wound. Jimmy felt hte pain but was not able to show it.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Help me..." Jimmy said, gargling on his own blood.
            </p>
            <p>
                "He's going under!" the medic yelled, and pressed on his chest delivering more pain to the wound, keeping jimmy awake, and giving him air. He coughed. The marine ran over with a 2 foot by 2 foot frabril with a metal structure. It unfolded into a stretcher and they lifted Jimmy up onto it.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Found two more survivors, they can't walk but everything else is fine," the other marine said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well come back and get you and them, right now we're getting Cpt' Raynor emergency help on Alpha," the marine said and they put the stretcher bed onto the back of the dropship.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Go!" the marine yelled, and the dropship took off. They closed the back door andd sat down. There was a trail of dirt into the shadow. The marine's eyes widened and he started to breathe heavy.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You people were going to leave me to die." It was Zeratul, and he held a ring.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What, what are you doing?" the marine asked. Zeratul fiddled with the ring. "This is what you Terran want, I prozume?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't know, they don't tell us everything about our mission, we just fight," the marine said. The medic was helping Jimmy.
            </p>
            <p>
                "This was in that chest. What your whole mission was about," Zeratul said. 
            </p>
            <p>
                "Where did all of your men go?" the marine asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Once they saw the 15,000 Zerg, we called for shuttles. I just happened to still be in the cathedral," Zeratul said. The dropship left the atmosphere.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Alpha is one mile away, prepare to unlock the door," the marine said. They got Jimmy's wheeling bed ready when the dropship came to a jolting stop.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dropship door lowered and Zeratul, the medic and the marine walked out. Zeratul kept the ring as he walked to Tutos' office. While walking, people looked at him, backed against the wall, and some even ran screaming. But Zeratul kept on walking. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Tutos say, his depression was coming from his mouth. The death of 3,870 men ate away at his stomach. He felt of throwing up. At that time Zeratul walked in. Behind him, President Lee. Zeratul felt for the ring.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well, Zeratul, we didn't—" but at that moment the men in the room's attention focused on the ring. Tutos stood.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You...how did you?" Tutos asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I almost died trying," Zeratul said. President Lee smiled.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I will contact Cpt. Uran. The Zerg won't dare touch us now," Lee said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Wait, we don't even know what it does," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Precisely. It's much more a danger than a treasure at this moment," Zeratul said. Lee swallowed.
            </p>
            <p>
                "They were guarding it, so it's obvious it does something extreme," Lee said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Maybe for them, not neccessarily for you," Zeratul said. Lee's face looked angry.
            </p>
            <p>
                "But if they didn't want us to have it, there's a good possibility we can do something with it, and that's what we have to find out, so we can replace or compensate for those who died, with power," Lee said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You can't replace lives, not ever!" Tutos yelled.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Look, they set a trap for us and we fell for it. Now that we have the ring, let's use it to get back at the Zerg. And have the upper hand!" Lee said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Easily said, but I have a bad feeling about the effect it'll have on you. You should contain the ring and what it holds inside it," Zeratul said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What? The ring holds something inside it?" Tutos asked and walked over to Zeratul.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, a small orb," Zeratul said. "The ring is just protecting it. My guess is that once the orb is free, so is the power. And that power is what I'm worried about." 
            </p>
            <p>
                Corseal and Arkanine walked in.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What the hell was that bullshit mission, huh General?" Corseal yelled. "A wild goose chase, killing off nearly half of our west Farlien forces. You are sitting here without a broose. Do you know how many people are down at the academy missing body parts?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Listen—"
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, you listen, was it you? Or was it Uran?" Corseal asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "One of you knew all along that this was a trap but you were willing to risk those men for that ring, that stupid hunk of junk that will probably backfire on us anyway," Corseal said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Look, I had no idea that it was a trap. Those are my men too! I have to sit here and take it, let it soak in that 4,000 men died under my control," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You're a bunch of lies, all of you. Zeratul is the only one with some Goddamn sense. The rest of you are power driven scum. President Lee, don't you have a disput on Farline to settle, why are you even here on a military vessel?" Corseal asked. Corseal and Arkanine walked out, cursing down the hall.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Sorry, I'm really sorry," Tutos told the two.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I have to get back to Farline, the vote for re-election is in hand," President Lee said.
            </p>
            <p>
                He walked out the door firmly and walked to the docking bay.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Where did the Kar'Athak flee to?" Zeratul asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We received a hail from them, they ran into some problems themselves. Well, so they say," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Here it is. The power that can control destiny. So they say," Zeratul said. "I'm sorry about all the men who died."
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, there was nothing anybody could do. It will not happen again though," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "That's not what your people want to hear," Zeratul said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I know, but I can't do it all," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The General title comes with responsibility Tutos. You led your people, they look up to you. That's a rare gift," Zeratul said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't care whose fault it is, the thing that kills me is that I could have changed it. I didn't have to just let those people die," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Let it go," Zeratul said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Death is a common thing."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Not 4,000 of them at one time," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You have bigger things to worry about now, General. Like the Zerg attacking again. They're not going to take this lightly," Zeratul said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, I know, we are taking the greatest precaussions that we can."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I hope you are," Zeratul said. "For your sake."
            </p>
            <p>
                Tutos' comlink blinked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We're receiving a hail from a Zyphlin frequency, I'll forward it through to you now," a voice on the other end said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "This situation's bad..." Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "And it's about to get worse," Zeratul said. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Tutos looked at the comlink, waiting. Then it turned green. The person on the other end spoke.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Did you get the note?" the voice asked. It was a sleek and shadowy voice.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, what note?" Tutos asked, listening intentively.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It should be there...now." And right at that moment a marine walked in with two pieces of paper. Tutos' face went red. He looked around for cameras.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Who are you?" Tutos asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The creator," the voice said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The creator of what?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Your madness."
            </p>
            <p>
                Tutos' hand formed a fist.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Who are you? Who do you work for?" Tutos asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The navigational coordinator told you when she passed me through to you, did she not?" the voice asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You want the ring?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I would rather the device inside of it," the voice said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well come and get it you mother—" the hailing frequency turned off.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Not exactly what I would have done, but it's one way," Zeratul said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What did he mean by the creator?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "That he created it," Zeratul answered.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What?" Tutos asked. He didn't want to believe it. "Then how did it get in the hands of the Zerg?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hundreds of years ago, before the time of Kerrigan, the Zerg stole it from them."
            </p>
            <p>
                Tutos picked up the notes and held them in front of his face.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Check for prints," Tutos said and took his gloves off. The marine took the blank one and walked to the lab. Tutos looked at the other wide eyed. "This isn't good," he said. "Whoever wrote this was very sincere about their belongings. They wrote that whoever possesses this item will be sucked in by its power."
            </p>

                "The person who wrote that is telling the truth," said Zeratul.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hell, I'm not going to chance this, I'll bring this down to the lab before the day ends," Tutos said. "Have it get a thorough examination, then we'll decide."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You don't understand. You won't see the evil in it until it's already affected something. Then it'll be too late," Zeratul said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Look, I'm going to get it examined and then I'm going to use it. We can't afford to wait any longer. Both the Zerg and Zyphlin, along with the Curan, want it back, and they aren't going to ring the doorbell. They're going to blow it down," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I understand. But we can't use it. Not until we know everything about it," Zeratul said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Look, I thank you. Your reward shall be 20,000 minerals to use upon whatever you wish. That's not my problem. But I'm going to ask you not to get in the way of the happenings of this orb," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What happens with that orb affects all populations. If something goes wrong, all races will pay. Be wise," Zeratul said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Now that we have the orb, there is a lot less to worry about," Tutos said, and clutched the ring within his hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, I'm afraid the worrying has only just begun..."

                <b>Syladar Stroke</b> overlooed his vessel's control room. The view screen rippled and so did everything else. It was a metallic like color and a watery paint like feel. It sent direct messages to the mind of the ship when someone entered an order. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Zyphlin's way of living was extremely sophisticated. Their home planet went by the name of Balaran, and swarmed with intelligence. Stroke was in charge of military forces. There was no such thing as ranks, just a few leaders, assassin groups, teams (strike) etc. Stroke was planning an assassin group to take out the high ranking Terran officers. The assassin group consisted of 8 members. One went by name of <b>Malir</b>. He led 7 other assassins which were highly rained in martial arts and weaponry. Malir was in the docking bay with his 7 men. They were a little like Protoss except more advanced, sly, and intelligent. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The ship they were ready to bard was a 100 ft. ship, smaller than the smallest cruiser. The cockpit was a 3 sided wall of metallic material, and one man sat. He was tapping at the material making ripples throughout the walls. Malir and his men stepped aboard and found seats close to the entrance. Each had a lazer pistol, some had knives, others had lazer machine guns, but more rifle like. Malir had a rifle and a machine gun, and knives. He was equipped.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ship lifted, the black blew clear, and the ship took off out of the surface of Balaran.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stroke sat at the contorl room, monitoring the ship closely.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Just follow the coordinates to Farline and follow the plan. Don't get seen, or it's all over," Stroke said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes," Malir said. the dropship flew through space. The assassins got their weapons out, along with Malir. The pilot hit the wall and the ripples hit each other.
            </p>

                <b>
                    Chapter 10: The Farline Code
                </b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Jim Raynor, his armor on tightly and his rifle in hand, walked down the dropship ramp onto the roof of the council building. The dropship took off again. The whole planet of Farline was one big city, busy and all. He walked down the stairs after punching in his code and entering a thumb print. President Lee was giving a speech for re-election time. A crowd of a thousand or more sat before him. Jimmy made his way down to there.
            </p>
            <p>
                "My whole life I thought about the people, and why not continue that. We now have an upper hand in the world of military politics. No one will dare touch us, ever," Lee said. The audience clapped.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Jimmy, robed men, high possiblity of a threat entering first floor of council building," a marine said through his comlink.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Watch them close," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "They are fascinaiting. Okay, have to go, they're here." Jimmy continued down the steps. He was on floor 72. The meeting was on 60. The time was past 9:00 PM on Farline and there was much that could hide in the dark.
            </p>
            <p>
                "All units, at your posts?" Jimmy asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes sir."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes sir."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Copy that."
            </p>
            <p>
                "First floor unit, do you copy. Al, come in! Someone check where Al is," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Units by President Lee, keep your eyes open," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm asking all of you to trust me in saying that I will make the next 10 years the best we've ever experienced," Lee said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Talk to me," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No sign of anyone at the front desk. No Al, sir," the marine said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay, hold your position. Elevator guard, do you copy?" Jimmy asked. There was no answer. "Hello?!" 
            </p>
            <p>
                "Get up to the President now!" Jimmy yelled. He ran down to 62. "I'm almost there myslef. All units report in."
            </p>
            <p>
                Jimmy made a fist. He opened the door to floor 60. He heard clapping. At least Lee was still alive. He was all alone excpet for the guards by him.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Look for extensive black robed people. If you see them, shoot them on sight!" Jimmy yelled. He walked in. The room was huge. The ceiling was at leeast 200 ft. high and there were rows and rows of people.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I will turn the lives of all of us to something that will be a gift."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Robed figure spotted, didn't get a good lock though, no lock either," a marine said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Follow them carefully," Jimmy whispered. The marine walked around a corner and a foot smacked across his helmet, knocking him to the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Did you get to see them?" Jimmy stood firmly. Whatever was in the building knew what they were doing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The assassins moved quietly up the stairs. The elevator shaft was too risky. Malir led with his rifle out in front of him. They entered the floor 60 door and heard Lee's voice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Malir walked around the corner, where there was a Do Not Enter sign. There was also a small sign that said "meeting in progress". The assassins got ready. Malir kicked open the door and ran in. the crowd panicked and noise filled the room. Jimmy turned and pulled out his desert eagle but Lee was vulnerable and he needed to help him. He tackled Lee to the ground and pushed him out the door with a marine.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Follow the president," Malir said. Two assassins ran after Lee. Jimmy dove by the podeum. It accepted two lazer shots and cracked. The other marine shot his rifle. The assassins drew closer and kicked it from his hands. Then a lazer shot blew through his visor and into his head. He fell to the ground. Meanwhile Jimmy ran to the door and down the hall. Malir and the five remaining assassins chased after him. They could run faster than humans, especially when the humans have huge armor on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jimmy shot behind him, keeping Malir's men around the corner for a few seconds. And before they came around he was off down the stairs. He heard the lazer shots and heavy footsteps trampling down the stairs.
            </p>
            <p>
                "All security, we need you at the Wst Houster building, the President is being attacked," Jimmy yelled, running down the steps. He heard the assassins only two floors above him. He shot up with his pistol but only hit the railing. His chest was getting really tired when he saw the sign for foor 45. He had an idea. He got off there and ran down the hall. The assassins didn't notice and continued but Malir stopped. He didn't hear big footsteps.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Het got off here," he said The assassins came up again.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Move on. We can't ponder on this one, get the President!" Malir ordered, and they all continued.
            </p>
            <p>
                President Lee and the marine got out of the building. There was a ship there and two marines were in the margin, above the ramp.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Come on sir!" one marine yelled. Then two assassins came out of the building.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Raise the ramp!" the marine yelled.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ramp started to raise when 3 lazers came through and nailed the marine. Lee sat against the wall.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Let's get out of here!" he yelled. The ship took off, leaving the assassins on the surface.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jimmy propelled himself down the stairs, jumping each 1/2 floor. Malir and the other five assassins stood on the road, watching the ship get further and further way.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Don't worry, I have a tracking device on it," one said. Then 12 marines came around the street corner. They were the reinforcements. The assassins found cover and so did the marines. They started to exchange fire.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jimmy heard the comotion and carefully opened the door. He pulled the trigger of his rifle. The assasins closest to him turned and fired with their pistols. Jimmy dove behind the same piece of rubble, it was just the other side of it. Then one reached over and grabbed him. He jolted to the side and the assassin lost his grip. Jimmy stood but the other assassin caught Jimmy off balance and dove into his chest. He fell down and hit the ground hard.
            </p>
            <p>
                Malir was secretively following the ship's path, slowly but surely. He followed the crowd. There were many scum, so he blended in. He slipped further and further down the street.
            </p>
            <p>
                An assassin's shoulder was hit by a bullet. A marine already lay dead on the cold ground and another was wounded. Jimmy grabbed the assassin by the neck and squeezed. Soon the robed invader fell firmly to the side. Jimmy rolled, pulled the rife from his side, and shot while rolling. The bullets didn't seem to hit the asssassins. Another two marines fell to their deaths. Jimmy elbowed a canaster down, revealing himself. The assassin jolted and pulled the trigger. Jimmy was already on the ground, in the minst of kicking the assasin's leg. It fell down, hitting the ground with a crack.
            </p>    
            <p>
                Malir looked down at his tracking locator monitor (tdlM) and saw that the ship had stopped. It was about one mile from him, on the road in which he was going. He sped up a little and looked behind him to make sure no one was following him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jimmy spotted an assassin at the corner of his eye and jumped backward, hitting the side of a building. Another marine fell to the ground. Jimmy looked up, he was breathing heavily too.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We had more cover than this!" he yelled into his comlink. He blazed fire upon a cluter of assassins, taking one down. the blood was clear, and the body was still. The others caught sight of him, that's when he ran. The four remaining marines supported Jimmy with cover fire until he got back to a safe structure that could support lazer fire. He was behind a cargo shaft. Sort of a construction area. The battle had moved to that area. The marines crept around, they saw him.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Watch your back," Jimmy said. The marines carefully went out into the open with an intention of only sneaking up on the assassins and hopefully killing them. Jimmy eyed the plan. This was all until he felt a cold point shove up agains his neck.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Don't speak, the assassin said behind him. He took Jimmy's rifle and eventually found his pistol. Jimmy was waiting to get shot in the back of the head but the time never came. He didn't hear movement behind him and the cold gunpoint was off is neck long ago. He slowly turned around, then let out a sigh of relief as his eyes took in that there was no one. He looked back at the marines. All four of them were on the ground, silent.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Oh shit," Jimmy said to himself.
            </p>
            <p>
                When he looked back he received a blow across the visor. His head hit the stone, broken up wall and nearly cracked it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                "I believe you have something of ours," said the assassin.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What? I know nothing of what you speak of." And then the asassin hit him again, and harder.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The treasure," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hmmm, yes," the assassin stated. 
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't have it, I'm not responsible enough," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Where is it, and do answer wiser this time," the assassin said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Umm," and he was kicked this time. But that time Jimmy grabbed the invader's leg and dislocated it. He fell.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Sweet dreams," Jimmy said. He took the gun from him and walked off. President Lee walked down the hall of the UCR building. His firm coat and hat told a story of anger. Soon he stopped, although he didn't have much of a choice. The hall had ended. He walked into an office. Canclave and two marines stood there.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I doubled the guard on each floor," Canclave said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Excellent, is the ring secure?" Lee asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Better than ever. It's in a seal that is, well, very good I should say," Canclave said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Excellent."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Indeed it is," Canclave said. The marines slowly walked to the door and when they got there they stayed there, rifles in 'full ready'.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Where is it?" Lee asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "On Alpha. General Tutos has it contained," Canclave said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Where?" Lee asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "On his finger," Canclave swallowed.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What! Do you know how valuable that is!" Lee was furious.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes I do know," Canclave said. "But I can't stop him from doing it, not from down here, and not by my rank."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay okay. Here is what we do. We kill these eight assassins before they take down the planet," Lee yelled. "Then we'll work from there. But until then, I'm staying here."
            </p>
            <p>
                Canclave nodded and walked out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jimmy was now on the streets. There were six asassins left, all of which hae had no clue where they were. He pondered upon the idea while slowly moving on the streets. He was the only one who stood out. He was bulked up and took big strides. No one looked at him strangely though. There was a path in the crowd that he caught with his eye, along with that came black sections. His adrenaline started up again.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Get out of the way!" he yelled.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some didn't and he simply pushed them to the ground. There were many "heys" and "watch yourselves" but Jimmy kept running.
            </p>
            <p>
                Malir casually walked into an alley, which was along side of the U.C.R. building. He climbed up, jumping from windowsill, and sometimes only brick held him up. He nearly glided he went so fast. He went right up to Lee's windowsill without Lee even knowing. Malir opened it slowly but a draft of wind came in and hit Lee's back. He turned. Malir was already there. The marines turned but Malir already had Lee in a head lock.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Drop the guns," Malir said. Lee's face was turning red. "Now before his head paints these walls." 
            </p>
            <p>
                Lee pushed against the desk, propelling himself and Malir backward. They hit the glass of the 20 story window and it reacted with a shatter. They both fell, Lee trying to get free, but what did it really matter now. There were great chances that both were going to be a decoration on the asphalt.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lee broke free anyway and then hit the entrance glass of the U.C.R. building. There were several layers of glass and it cut through his flesh. After that he hit the foyer tile wit ha thump and the glass fell on top of him. He didn't move. Blood slowly came from his body, leaking almost as if a pipe had snapped. Marines came running through the elevator shaft.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Get a med kit!" one yelled. Lee lay on his stomach, eyes closed, heart beat saying very little. Jimmy came running through.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Once I saw Lee and the other fall out the window, I stopped following the other assassins. There's no body out there," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Jesus, no one can fall 20 floors and just get up and walk off. Especially with the little armor those guys had on," the marine said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh they had armor alright, they are just farm more advanced than us," Jimmy said. The marine came back with the med kid and knelt next to Lee.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We gotta get him to the academy, and fast," a marine said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The closest one from here is about 31 miles," a marine said, treating the wounds the best he could.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We're better off getting him to that old Ministell a mile away. It's not as good but it'll keep him alive," Jimmy said. The other marines agreed.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Get him back to his ship and get him there," Jimmy said. The marines took President Lee to his ship immediately.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Jimym stood there, nearly standing in a puddle of viscous blood.
            </p>
            <p>
                "All units, check all docking bays for take off of those assassins," Jimmy said. He walked out and was back on te busy street where he came from previously. He didn't stand anymore, he was hunched, and he weeped.
            </p>

                </i>
            </p>
            <p>
                The crowd kept going and so did Jimmy. He finally made his way to the Ministell
            </p>
            <p>
                "Wheree is he?" Jimmy asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "At the end of the hall in the big room, Cpt. Raynor," the tall woman pointed and then looked back with a gritty look on her face. 
            </p>
            <p>
                He ran back, making large "clings" and slides. When he got down to the end a marine opened it for him. He walked in. Every possible treatment that Lee should have, he did. He lay still, the closest to death he'd ever been. His face was covered in bandaes and his nose and mouth cover gave him air. Jimmy stood there, along with 7 other marines, and about 4 doctors.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Cpt., we have a ship leaing now. They looked like humans but they moved quickly," the marine said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "How many?" Jimmy questioned through his comlink.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Seven."
            </p>
            <p>
                Jimmy thought that it was impossible for the assassins to be the ones on the ship, there were only five...
            </p>
            <p>
                Then he remembered two more got away.
            </p>
            <p>
                "That's the ship! Get wraiths on it now, or anything with a gun that can fly!" Jimmy said loudly. "This is not happening," he thought to himself. The life monitor told someone of a straight line, which meant low activity throughout the body.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Give me an update," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I ordered two wraiths on them, another is on its way," the marine said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Good, follow the ship tightly, I want an update in 5 minutes," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes sir," the marine answered back. Befeore long there was the next update. Jimmy stood, curiously.
            </p>
            <p>
                "There's fire! A wraith is getting hit. The ship is fighting," the voice came in staticky, and then there was no voice at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                "God damnit," Jimmy said rather softly, compared to his previous tone. He backed up against the wall. He was sure that nothing like this would ever happen, but it just did.
            </p>
            <p>
                He joined the military when he wa in his teenage years and now he's almost 30. Fifteen years of hard work to let a President nearly die.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay let's pack it up," a marine said. Then Canclave came in.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What happened?" Canclave asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "An assassin got to him, we're giving him all the treatment we can right now but it doesn't look good," a marine said. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, with no warning, the life monitor showed a straight line. A tear fell from the main doctor's eye and hit the ground slowly and loudly.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                The next day it was announced that the President of the human race had died. They put Lee on a bed and sent him into a burning room to creamate him. The day was March 15, the year wasn't said to anyone. It reminded them of history leaving Earth. Th resources from Earth were gone hundreds of years back. Not it wa stime to re-colonate, but why? Only one person knew that and that was President Lee.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jimmy silently sat in a dropship with 7 marines. President Lee had told them, but not a reason why. Canclave was the best witness. He saw the anger on Lee's face when he told him Tutos had the ring. It was a mystery that only could be solved within the rest of the council, and possibly military officers. Cpt. Uran was no longer a Cpt. His title was General and he was the leader of all military forces. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Alpha had its orders to orbit Earth, a surveillance mission. A calm one but there was a possibility it could get messy. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The dropship's destination was Alpha. They were to discuss the re-election, and the re-colonization of Earth. Jimmy was very curious why they were going back to Earth. He lost both of his parents leaving Earth. He had one brother had headn't seen for over 17 years. He joined the military because there was nothing left for him. Dead parents, lost brother, and a heck of a load of anger. 
            </p>
            <p>
                They originally left Earth because of resources, there was nothing left. All the oil was used up, almost all of the trees were one, and the industrial parts of Earth were gone, hence no oil or gas.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dropship came to a halt. 
            </p>
            <p>
                "All units in cargo area, lowering ramp," the dropship pilot said. Jimmy and the marines stood slowly and waited for the ramp to stop. There were two escort marines at the bottom.
            </p>
            <p>
                "General Tutos wants you in the MMR, Cpt." one marine said (MMR = main meeting room).
            </p>
            <p>
                The two marines led him out of the docking back and down the hall. Jimmy wondered what Tutos was going to say. Probably something about the re-election and colonization of earth, but the exact words were obviously anonymous to Jimmy. The marines stopped on either side of the MMR, making a suitable path for Jimmy. He walked in and saw Tutos and the council sitting there.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Nice to see you again, Cpt. Raynor," Tutos examined the papers before him.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Howdy, General," Jimmy answered.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm sorry to hear that Lee died. But for that misforuntate event comes another difficulty. Re-election. I wish to go through a stage of mourning but frankly I don't have the time. We have to swipe Earth clean before we even make any kind of thought of going back there," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why exactly are we going back to Earth, General?" Jimmy asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We picked up thick material beneath the surface, and it's very possible there are still riches there, that we should take advantage of," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The place is a dump. What's the real reason you like Earth so suddenly, General?" Jimmy asked. There was a fairly long strip of silence amongst the room's space.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Dominion settlements say they can break open the ring and unleash the orb's power," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Wait a minute, the Dominion have settlements on Earth already? Well isn't that a good image for our race. Protoss helps us and the Dominion doesn't," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well, we have a better relationship with Protoss," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes but the Dominion are human. It was the battle to live for our race," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "But they almost are a separate race. It's like when Russia broke up, they are all humans still, but they have different beliefs, ways of war, religion, and points of view," Tutos ended.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay, you win. Why do you want to talk to me about re-election, I have no bid in it, and my vote will still be there," Jimmy wondered.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It's not about re-election. It's about Earth," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Somehow, I knew you were going to say that. My pointi of view is we don't colonize it, we just wait. We don't want war with the Dominion now, we can't afford it," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I agree. For now I'm setting up several boot camps far from the Dominion settlements. We need to recruit more men, for the great loss in the battle."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Let me guess, you want me to instruct these new recruits," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes and no. I'm holding you responsible for one camp, and security. Secruity is a minor job so, basically, yes. For the next week I'd like you to run one of the camps," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay, that's fair enough, what's in it for me?" Jimmy asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "A stripe. That would give you three stripes," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Deal," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Get a good night's rest tonight and we'll have you down there tomorrow."
            </p>
            <p>
                "The camps are already constructed?" Jimmy asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Two are," Tutos answered. "Take this." Tutos handed Jimmy a folder, which was very thick. "It's the 50 men in your camp, orders, schedule, and that's just about it," Tutos ended.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay, what's the catch?" Jimmy asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The catch is, there is no catch. The catch is the General wants to help the Captain. You know, common courtesy," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I believe you, for now," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Your bed for the night is, and I'm expecting a thank you after this, in hall 8, next door to Vellen Des Coronian. It's a big room that I think you know already," Tutos said. His left hand was under the table the whole conversation and Jimmy left with suspicion. Tutos didn't get a thank you. The council stood.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well, we should be on our way to Farline. There's an important conference about how we're going to do election day," Senator Elyor said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tutos gave a nod, and when they lefet he put his ring hand up on the table. It was glistening in the light. Tutos smiled as it reflected off the pupil part of his eye. It was gold and fancy. The orb sat silently inside.

                "Greetings, Hellside. The twelve human officers are in position, in the nydus canal adjacest to the west ergling hive," Kerrigan's voice grew darker as her sentence went on.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Excellent. Tell the Curan that their men are free to take their picks," <b>Hellside</b> grinned.

            <p>
                "Immediately," Kerrigan paused.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Nydus canal dropped membrane from the roof. It was alive, the whole building was slithering. Some of the 12 men were half dead, all were drugged and approaching insane. There was 2 ft. of shadow around the inside, and even that moved, but faintly.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Who's there! I don't want to die, I can reason with you, I can tell you where the human's next settlement is. Just don't kill me," the human's voice evolved into a cry. But out of the shadow was not a Zerg life form but something in a dark robe.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I hope you say false things." It was a human voice.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Ummm, yes! I wouldn't, um, do it," the voice trailed off.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't have the time to help all of you," the human started. "But I will help the six that look the most healthy, so don't sulk," the human said. He looked around and walked over to the first one.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Come on Narta, wake up," the human said. 
            </p>
            <p>
                "Who are you?" he easked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Lietuenant Estolav. We used to work together. Come on, I'm gonna get you outta here," Estolav said. Narta wiggled.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I can't move," he said. Estolav took a knife from his belt and cut hard, chicken line maerial off of Narta's arms,, legs and waist restraint. Narta fell to the cold and "lively" ground. All he was wearing was shirt and pants. Outside they heard moans. The doors barged in, Curan soldiers walked in. Estolav pulled his pistol from his belt and shot twelve times. The three soldiers fell without getting a shot off.
            </p>
            <p>
                "This way." Estolav led Narta to a cut off part of the nydus canal.

            <p>
                "My ship is out ten feet away. The Protoss helped me with this one. It's a mind controlled mutalisk," Estolav said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Wha—no please don't," Narta stumbled on his words.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You're being affected by the drugs they gave you."

            <p>
                "Colonel, come on the back of this creature and hold onto the lab bar," Estolav said. They both got on. The mutalisk flapped off, high into the sky.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hang on tight!" Estolav yelled. "Once we get too high that it's hard to breathe, tap my shoulder and we'll jump!" Estolav yelled.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Just kiddin, we'll stay at this level of height. Just checkin' if you were awake," Estolav said. The mutalisk moaned.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Sit tight, my real ship is about one mile ahead," Estolav said. But Narta's hands were slipping.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Land!" he yelled.

            <p>
                "Now!" Narta yelled.
            </p>
            <p>
                Estolav hit the mutalisk and it flew downward. Narta's left hand slipped off and his right one didn't have that great of a grip. Estolav looked back when Narta slipped. He reached back and grabbed Narta's foot. Soon his grip was almost gone. The foot started to slip. Estolav was getting stretched like leather while Narta was hanging over the edge.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We're dropping!" Estolav yelled. Narta's foot was sore but, most of all, he saw about 1,000 stories between him and the grund. Estolav moaned.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Ahhhhh," he yelled. Then his hand let go of the lap bar and he slid back to the second lap bar. He was wedged between it and the mutalisk's back. He then could grab Narta with two hands. Still it was close to impossible. The wind added 200 pounds and Narta was 200 pounds. It was extremely hard. They descended to about 200 stories when Estolav broke free of his wedge, sending him around back. 
            </p>
            <p>
                He didn't have a grip of Narta anymore. He didn't see him either. But Narta was hanging on under the flying Zerg creature. Estolav was breathing heaivily when the mutalisk set down on the surface. Narta rolled from under it.
            </p>
            <p>
                "My ship's about 1,000 yards ahead of us. We should make it there without hassle. There aren't much Zerg between here and my ship," Estolav said. He helped Narta up and gave him one of the two pistols from his belt.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Shoot anything that slithers," Estolav said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "This whole planet's slitherin'," Narta said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Quickly, follow me," Estolav said. Narta followed Estolav.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Try not to shoot, let's hide," Estolav said. Narta dove to the side. They were ini an open field and nothing was around.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, when you see something hide instead of shoot I meant," Estolav said. "You're still drugged, maybe it was a bad idea to give you that gun."
            </p>
            <p>
                Narta got up.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Crap, get down again. A zergling patrol group!" Estolav jumped down, taking Nara with him. Te tall grass stood 4 feet tall, 3 feet in the wind.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Just stay down, we can't face twelve of them," Estolav said, very quietly. The shadows came, blocking the sun. Slow soft steps pounded against the ground next to them. Saliva dripped down on the blade of grass in front of Narta. The growl was faint but the shadow was strong. The sound of the claws scraping the ground made the two not move at all. A chill ran up their back. Then a gunshot went off. Estolav turned seeing a Zergling on the ground and Narta's pistol in the air.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I told you not to!" Estolav whispered loudly.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Too late," Narta said. The other 11 zerglings charged. Estolav, angry at Narta, whipped his pistol out in front of them and the two humans shot.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two leading zerglings fell, moaning, as Estolav and Narta sidestepped to avoid a zergling's coarse jump at them. But both had to duck down immediately to avoid 3 foot claws that nearly formed a hook. Narta purposely fell and kicked the zergling, only the beast was heavily armored and Narta's foot just bounced off. Both had little armor, Narta had none! One clean sweep of a claw and he was surely dead. Estolav only had a little, he would be paralyzed if he got hit. But Estolav blocked a strike with his pistol and surprisingly stayed in one piece. He jumped back into another zergling who was dwelling on Narta, so that gave Estolav a half of a second to turn away. It was an obstacle course and if you made the wrong turn you were dead.
            </p>
            <p>
                Narta emptied his 20 round clip into a pair of zerglings. Neither were dead.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Throw me a clip!" Narta yelled. Estolav reached down when he had a second to spare and chucked a clip in the air, over to Narta. It landed in the grass. Narta bent down, rummaging his hands through the grass. A zergling's eye linked to his desperate urge to find the clip. It charged, growling and spitting. When it got close it opened its mouth, when suddenly a bullet it the beast's throat, sending it to the ground. There were still four left. Both were out of ammo and didn't stand a chance against a zergling. They backed up.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Try and get back to the mutalisk, we have a 20 foot headstart. We might make it," Estolav said. Then a stream of smoke painted the sky. It grabbed all attention, then landed. And the zerglings ran off.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Follow me. Come on, hurry!" the voice called. It was human! Without question the two followed the human who actually looked alien. They followed, but cautiously. He led them to Estolav's ship.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Thank you. Now I will go through my standard procedure of questions. Who are you, what are you?" Estolav puzzled upon the thought.
            </p>
            <p>
                "<b>Sergeant Will Tooly</b>."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You're human and you work in the Terran military?" Estolav asked.
            </p>
            <p>
            "I did, anyway. Then I crash landed on this planet and have been here for the past eight years." Tooly examined the two officers. "I made some kind armor out of plates from different zerg units, cammo from leaves, etc. It seems to work well. I've stayed alive all of these years."
            </p>
            <p>
                "How did you scare them away? Zerg never react that way," Estolav said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well, I have a scent on that smells like Aral's tomb," Tooly said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Aral?" Estolav asked impatiently.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The lord of the Cubal goes by the nam Aral," Tooly said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why would that scare off the Zerg?" Estolav asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm not exactly sure but I learned that it was Aral's smell from a book. He smells like creek water," Tooly said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Interesting. We'll be getting off this planet now. Hop on, unless of course you want to say," Estolav joked, as he got into the cockpit. Narta followed Estolav in. Tooly (sadly) reluctantly walked in. Then strapped himself in. He shivered, scared to leave his home for all these years. But as Tooly thought about it, he realized that of course, staying on Char would kill him eventually. The ship started up with a quick discharge of orange flame out the back.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Commencing lifet off formation, everyone strap yourselves in. This thing moves." And like that, the ship took off. Narta leaned back and breathed softly.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We can't thank you enough," Narta said. "Our General would probably want to meet you," Narta said. Tooly turned away.
            </p>
            <p>
                "He isn't my General anymore," Estolav said, with an even look on his face.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What do you mean?" Narta asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I quit the military when you quote on quote died. That's not why, but that's when. I really want to know what's going on, ow many more have died since I left." Estolav looked angry.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What's wrong with the military?" Narta asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You know perfectly well." There was silence.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well, I don't have much of a choice, there is nowhere to go for me if I quit the military. I'm almost fourth stripe," Narta said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "That's what everyone says. All I thought of was Captain, just two more stripes, then Admiral, and then Colonel. It traps you until you finally die, or become Tutos. In your 40's and you're leading men to their deaths. Sad," Estolav said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I would probably be Captain now but instead I'm eight years behind," Tooly said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "When I was a kid, 30 some years back, the General was Sergi, now hei's probably 58, 60. He was the youngest General known to man," Tooly said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I think Sergi is now on Farline, retired of course. He works in a council building," Narta said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Who knows, you've been gone for a while," Estolav reassured Narta.
            </p>
            <p>
                "That's true."
            </p>
            <p>
                Tooly saw the blackness of space, which he hadn't seen for eight years. The stars glistened through his eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Whoa, massive ships orbiting Earth," Estolav said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Earth?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, Earth."
            </p>
            <p>
                Tooly looked at the blue-green planet. Hundreds of Terran vessels circled it.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't want to know what's going—" Narta's voice was cut off.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Alpha is here. I'm hailing it," Estolav said. "Yes we wish to board, number is 047-6720-8341-6661," Estolav finished.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Access granted, enter airlock passage four," a voice tore through.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Not much has changed, so it looks," Estolav said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "There's always change," Narta said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tooly saw Alpha and held his breath. It was the factor of nervousness. Narta saw the expression and knew Tooly was scared.
            </p>
            <p>
                They entered airlock passage four, with two surprised faces and one nervous look. The ship halted and jolted the three crew members forward a little bit.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Here goes nothing," Estolav said. They sat until the airlock doors opened.
            </p>

            <p>
                The marines looked at Jimmy with sincerity. 
            </p>
            <p>
                "No."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, a week and I get a stripe. I like that deal," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "This is not boyscouts, this is war. The President was assassinated and you are going off training teens! I don't approve!" the marine yelled.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It doesn't matter if you don't approve, it's my choice," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Look, we need you. Someone else could easily train those men," the marine said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well, I need to do this," Jimmy said. The marine bit down on his lower lp.
            </p>
            <p>
                "They need me, we need them, it works," Jimmy said. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The marine squinted his eyes. Jimmy ended the debate by taking his suitcase and pack to the airlock entrance. The door was closed and the red light was on. Seconds later the door opened and three men stood there. 
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hi, this is my ship, not a dropship," Estolav said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Who aer you? What the...Colonel? Who are the two people with you?" Jimmy asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What? Who are you?" Estolav asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Captain Jim Raynor, I'm going down to Earth to train men. This information would be classified but—"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay shut up, go to airlock 5. That's the one that will take the dropship soon," Estolav said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Look, I meant no offense," Jimmy said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I had a bad day," Estolav siad. He lead Narta and Tooly out of the ship and down the hall. Jimmy shook his head in disbelief.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Nice to meet you, too," he said to himself, and gathered his things before walking to airlock passage 5.
            </p>
            <p>
                Estolav led Tooly to where he last knew of Tutos to be. Hallway 8 of course, and it didn't change. They stood at the door. Tutos busy in his stack of files three feet high, was looking down. Narta walked in with Tooly behind him. Estolav stayed at the doorway.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tutos heard the footsteps and looked up. His hand dropped the pen that was in his hand. It dropped on top of his files. His mouth and eyes froze until words found a solemn path out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wha...you're really here?" Tutos asked. He stood.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Colonel Narta, oh my God. I thought you were dead. Where have you been?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I have been dead. In my my mind at least. I was about to get eaten when Estolav came and saved me. I was on Char," Narta said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Estolav? Char!" Tutos' eyebrows moved in several directions. Estolav walked in and pulled down his hood.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You left, you've changed your mind?" Tutos laughed.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why is that funny?" Estolav's voice brewed seriousness.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well Lieutenant, you finally came back after all these months, looking the same as when you left," Tutos said. "Who's your other companion?"
            </p>
            <p>
                Tooly stepped to the side and Tutos' face went from happy to angry. He got up and walked over.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You ungrateful piece of—" he punched Tooly square in the face. "Get him off the vessel!" Tutos yelled.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What, what's wrong with Sergeant Tooly, General?" Narta asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Sergeant? He's a General. The old leader. He's done terrible, terrible things and he should be punished. And he comes back here on my ship!" Tutos yelled. "Bad move."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Look, keep your hands to yourself," Estolav joked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Shut up. Get off my ship and take Mr. Strangelove over here. Get off my ship, Tooly," Tutos simply demanded. "Narta, stay please. I need to speak with you."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Estolav saved my life and so did Tooly. They deserve food, clothing and shelter for the night," Narta demanded.
            </p>
            <p>
                "One night won't hurt I guess, and then you leave. Estolav, if you want to join there are—"
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, I quit and I thought about it before I quit so I'm done." Estolav's very brief speech reached Tutos' ears and Tutos nodded.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You two are in rooms four and five. Go, leave!" Tutos waved his hands and the two officers walked out.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Colonel, I'm surprised you've made it this far," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Me too. I was trapped in an organic prison. Tortured, forced to do labor, on a ship, and I forget what else," Narta said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well, those times are over. Now you're back with us and I'm glad that you are. I sent Captain Jim Raynor down to one camp on Earth to recruit some new men to compensate for those we lost in battle," Tutos stated.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Earth?"

                "Yeah, I need you to instruct some of the men in training (AMIT). Only for a week. Your reward shall be, if you train well, a Badge of Tourenship."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why Earth? Why not Alsays? A planet that we already have settlements on!" Narta stood, senseless. "I guess I'm really out of the scoop on this one."
            </p>
            <p>
                "What do you expect! You've been gone for almost a year and you want a doctoral. I'm trying to get this process moving!" Tutos yelled.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What process?" Narta snapped back.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tutos realized that he had slipped in anger.
            </p>
            <p>
                "So it's true, you do have the ring," Narta said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "How the hell should you know? You've been in a goddamn cell for a year!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Overheard conversations. Zerg can speak. I faked being asleep and heard some guy named Hellside talking to Kerrigan. That's all, but the two of them said something about the ring and a high ranked Terran officer possessing it. Now where do you have it kept?" Narta asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tutos realized that his left hand had been under the table for almost the whole time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'ts somewhere safe, don't worry. I have it—"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Bullshit! Where eis it!" Narta yelled.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Where is it? In compartment B-6, in room 7. It's right next door but you're an exception to knowing this. No one else can know, do you understand?!" Tutos ordered, pointing his <i>right</i> hand at Narta.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'll do the Earth recruitment, but then I'm back here," Narta said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, I'm perfectly fine with that," Tutos stated. Narta calmed down and fixed his shirt that had six holes and rips in different places.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Your room is where eit always is, your pick up time is 2:00 AM tomorrow morning. It's about an hour down to the surface of Earth," Tutos stated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Narta walked out without any comment. He trked to his room and closed the door behind him. "Boot camp recruitments?" he thought. It was going way too far. 
            </p>
            <p>
                He walked further into the room when a piece of fabric fell over his mouth and muffled his yelling followed up with a hard slam in the back of his head. He fell softly to the ground.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                "Why didn't you tell me that you were a General?" Estolav questioned.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't know. I'll tell you one thing, something's fishy. We both don't know what Tutos is up to," Tooly said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yeah, I'll find out in the morning. Garuanteed early kick-out by tutos. Get a good night's rest, I'm right in this room if you need anything. I know this ship so I probably know your question," Estolav stated.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Good night." And the two wofficers walked into their rooms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Narta awoke, tied to a chair and blindfolded. Two robed men sat on his bed.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Your friend Jim Raynor doesn't clean a ship before he boards it," a voice said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Jim Raynor is hardly a friend, he's under my command and I am friendly with him," Narta said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I know your rank and number of years in the military, so I'm going to ask you this, simply and straightforward, where's the orb?" the voice echoed through Narta's head and the decision of telling or not telling was up in the air.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't," but he thought again. "It's in room 7, B-6 storage compartment," Narta said. He heard the door open and close.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well, that was easy enough. No broken bones, no dirty floors, etc.," the voice said. "Let me tell you one thing though, I don't like humans. Stupid and power hungry. You don't know what the orb can do, you just think that it does something powerful," the voice echoed through Narta's mind again. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Narta gathered all his strength and lifted. The chair ripped from its brace on the floor, followed where the voice came from and tackled something. He struggled, arms and legs tied back, two eyes that weren't in use. He took a hard blow to the face and then was kicked off.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Exactly my point," the voice said. Then there was a knock at the door. Narta sat on the overturned chair.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It's me," a voice came through the door. The robed man opened the door only to receive a knife in the throat. His comrade fell dead as well. Estolav stroked through to see Colonel Narta lying there defenseless. He pulled the blindfold from his eyes and pulled the shards of metal from Narta's wrist. Men were at the door and talking grew amongst them.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay show's over, get me a medic in here on the double, with two body bags," Estolav said, and Narta rolled over.
            </p>
            <p>
                "First day back and already a goddamn attack," Estolav said to himself. He helped Spartan up at once and turned to the door. Estolav paced to Tutos' office.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well, do you know Narta is here?" It was a rhetorical question.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What is this?" Tutos asked, stopping his work.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Two guys got on your ship too, trying to suck information from him and then kill him," Estolav said
            </p>
            <p>
                "You were in there?" Tutos was puzzled.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, I was at the door. Here's how it goes. I was walking to get a bite to eat when a roboed person came out of Narta's room."
            </p>
            <p>
                "That could have been you," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Very funn. This is really how it went. I then took a knife from my belt, which I always carry, and take him down. I drag him to the door and listen. All I hear is room 7, in compartment B-6, then the rest was not clear except for a bunch of ruckus. Tumbling, moaning, and that's where I tried the door. It was locked, by something humans can't do. So I knock, say it's the guy, he opens and I take him."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Interesting story. I have no idea how they got on this ship but I'll find out before long," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What's in room 7, compartment B-6?" the question was up.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't know," the lie was placed on the table.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You have no idea what he could be talking about?" Estolav questioned.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, I have absolutely no idea," Tutos lied further.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We'll see," Estolav said, and walked out. Narta stood in the hall with no wounds.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You don't know how much I want to get them back. The indefication's Zyphlin," Narta said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Zyphlin? Why would they be here?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "The ring. Or the orb," Narta said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What? What are you talking about?" Estolav questioned.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Look, the orb is in room 7, you have to know this. Tutos told me it was there and told men not to tell anyone," Narta said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tooly walked down.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I heard the comotion, what happened?" Narta looked at Tooly. 
            </p>
            <p>
                "I was attacked by two assassins. Not right away did they actually want to kill me but they were going to. Estolav saved my ass again."
            </p>
            <p>
                "That's two you owe me, Colonel," Estolav said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Goddamnit, now I gotta sleep with my gun," Narta said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Lock the door, too," Estolav said, walking back to his room. Tooly looked back down the hall, where men were cluttered and investigating, then he looked back at Tutos' room...
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Jimmy's head pushed against the cold metal of the side wall of the dropship. Two marines sat across from him. His head held numerous thoughts. One of the marines sat asleep, the other fought to stay awake. He hadn't had sleep for 90 hours and couldn't sleep now. Jimmy slept like a king but now he was wide awake and ready to train. He held the file that Tutos gave him up on his legs. Each page had a picture of the person in the group. Each had a ten page file. The file contained their whole lives, from when they were born to current date. Jimmy closed the file and swallowed th thought of training. But it was there, and what he swallowed was hopefully his anger.
            </p>
            <br />

                <b>

            </p>
            <p>
                Tooly lay sleeping on his bed. The shadow moved, slowly but surely. He lay flat and silent and didn't hear anything. Even if he was awake there wasn't any sound. The shadow crept. He crept up to the foot of the bed. A knife was in his hand. When he turned on the light, Tooly awoke.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Malir? What the hell are you doing here!" Tooly whispered loudly.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You have to tell your race what it does, or we'll take it."
            </p>
            <p>
                "They're not my race anymore," Tooly said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Then who is! You're the only one who knows besides us what that orb does. You must give it to us," Malir said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tooly sat up straight and thought.
            </p>
            <p>
                "If they're not your race anymore, then what's there to think about?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Come on. You know me, I always think about stuff extensively. This is not something to be taken lightly," Tooly said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay, I understand," Malir said. He sat.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The thing also is that there are dozens of codes that I don't know. It would be impossible to get it," Tooly said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "All I need is your support and I'll do the rest. I can break codes," Malir said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't doubt that you can, but I just can't do this," Tooly said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why must we be the only race with intelligence," Malir said under his breath.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Here's your chance, half the ship is sleeping. Do it to save your race, and everyone else," Malir said. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Tooly got out of bed, walked over to the door.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Good choic," Malir said, nodding his head slightly. Tooly didn't look back, he just walked out. Malir sat on the bed. Tooly walked down the hall, seeing the room numbers placed on the walls. He passed Tutos' office. Luckily, the door was closed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tooly walked on to room four. It was the longest hallway on Alpha! It consisted of all officers' offices, ten spare rooms, and the workout room. Tooly approached the parallel to room five.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                The dropship tore into Earth's atmosphere. It roared as the engines minimized and speed decreased.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Surface will be reached in ten minutes," the dropship pilot said.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Tooly stopped at room 7 and turned to the doorway. It said restricted on it. "I hope these codes are cracked," Tooly thought to himself. Malir had a laptop in front of him and pressed enter. The door light to room 7 opened green.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tooly got even more scared when the door opened. He got right to the case and cracked it open. Blood samples! Tooly checked the title on the case again. It read B-6. His face turned red.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Seems kind of late to be snooping around," Tutos' voice broke the near silence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tooly turned around.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why?" Tutos askked with a smile.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why what?" Tooly asked back.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why did you come in here, General?" Tutos freshly set his tone upon the room.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tooly didn't know what to say. He sunk his head.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't agree with these blood—"
            </p>
            <p>
                But before Tooly could finish his lie, he saw the ring on Tutos' finger. Tooly pretended like he didn't see it but Tutos noticed.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It's beautiful, isn't it?" Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes it is. Why do you have it?" Tooly questioned.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It's just so beautiful," Tutos ignored Tooly's thoughts.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Tutos, what are you doing! Do you even know what will happen if you activate that orb!" Tooly yelled.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes. I know your fear though," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: lucida sands unicode; color: grey;">
                <i>(October 11th, 2002)</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                "It's everyone's fear. Not one person can control the orb. It's too powerful. And you don't even know what it does," Tooly said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "See, that's the thing. I'm going to find out what it does shortly and use it for protection. For my own race's health," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It's easy to say that, but you will fall into a trap that you will never break free from. You won't see it coming until it's too late," Tooly finished.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Do you know what it is?" Tutos asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No." Tooly was smarter this time. It was a lie but, if he didn't, he knew something bad would happen, something out of the lines of a lecture. Tutos already didn't like him and anything could make it worse.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You will be punished for going through unauthorized property," Tutos said. "Also, if I feel like it, I'll not put in a good word for you." That meant destroying a life without destroying a person.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tutos slipped a pair of handcuffs out from his belt.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You know the drill," Tutos stated and approached Tooly. "You'll be held in containment until I decide what to do with you."
            </p>
            <p>
                Tooly put out his hands and felt the cold metal grip his wrists. He wondered where Malir was, but came to the conclusion that hhe was still in the room. If enough people knew that Tutos had the ring, they could get it.

                Jimmy felt the dropship stop and the back door and ramp funneled outward. Jimmy got up with the two marines and walked down the ramp. A few buildings lay before them. Flags, different flags with several colors and a symbol in the center. Jimmy trekked over to one of the buildings. Two men were next to the entrance.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Identification," one said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Captain Jim Raynor," Jimmy said and pulled a small ID card from his belt. It contained a picture of him in the center, and then information around it.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay, you're cleared." The voice was weak and annoyed. It was 2:00 AM. Jimmy walked in. Dozens of men slept in bunk beds. Jimmy rubbed his head as he realized what he was doing again. He put down his things and saw one man sitting there.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hello, who are you?" Jimmy asked. The man didn't answer. His outline in the shadow was still there, though.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I can't sleep, Raynor," the voice said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "How do you know my name?" Jimmy asked, but the outline was gone. He walkeed to the back room where there was a bed for him. He sat and continued to look through the file. There were at least 150 men on the list. Tutos had said differently. But Tutos is Tutos and that, as far as anyone knew, would never change...
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Tutos knocked on the door to Tooly's room. He knew someone else was with him to put him up to it. Tutos knew Tooly well, they had a past that went back nearly their whole lives. And they hated each other. You figure that they had at least 20 years of solid interaction, most likely more.                
            </p>
            <p>
                There was no answer to the door. Tutos' thoughts still remained focused upon the contents of the room.
            </p>
            <p>
                "This is General Tutos of the Alpha vessel. If you don't open the door in 30 seconds, I will open it, along with a few buddies." 
            </p>
            <p>
                The clock ticked in Tutos' mind. At the ten second mark the door opened. Tutos' sidearm was released by his own hand and he pointed the weapon at Malir.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hello, I don't know who you are but you'v just gotten yourself a life sentence of PP (planet prison)," Tutos said with a straight face. "On your knees."
            </p>
            <p>
                Malir got down to his knees.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The ring has already chosen you," he said while Tutos got out his second pair of handcuffs. He stopped in his tracks, dead silent. It was th first thing in a long time that really made him thhing. His face was stunning.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Pardon?" Tutos questioned as if he didn't want to hear Malir's words.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The ring everyone speaks of, is on your finger is it not?" Malir asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "How did you get on this ship?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Your security's low, and your men are mindless. I doubt you're much different, according to the action you're taking with the ring," Malir stated.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What action?"
            </p>
            <p>
                Malir looked up and looked straight into Tutos' eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Wearing it." And then he looked back down. It just made Tutos more angry and he cuffed Malir firmly.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Join your friend in containment, you bastard," Tutos' angry tone vanquished. Malir smiled. He knew he was making Tutos think hard. Not enough to change his mind about what he wants to do, but some food for thought that will never go bad. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Tutos grabbed Malir by the collar and walked him down the hall. If Tutos knew that Malir assassinated President Lee, Malir would probably be dead.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Jimmy's eyes oftenly drifted to the clock. Nothing had changed in the two hours. He read all of the men's files and took notes. His head's pain was getting worse. Each minute he got angrier that his job was going to suck. All up until that point, he accepted it and swallowed hard.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were footsteps coming down the barracks hall. He looked at his doorway to see a man in uniform, with combed hair and a fairly decent look on his face.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Jim Raynor isn't it?" the man put out his hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes," Jimmy shook it. He wasn't much of a chit chat kind of guy but he knew he had to suck it up.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm <b>Olas</b>, Chief Director of this new facility back on Earth. To you I'd be Lieutenant Olas," the man smiled. He was fairly tall, not overweight, and in his 30s. His hair was thick and brown.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Who's the one that—" but Jimmy didn't want to insult the person.
            </p>
            <p>
                Is a bit strange?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes."
            </p>
            <p>
                "That's Mitch Lelly. He's made 12 suicide attempts in the past year."
            </p>
            <p>
                Jimmy flipped to Mitch's picture. He was 15, and the file said that his parents died when he was 12 and he hasn't yet recovered. But <i>he</i> says that he always hated them.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm guessing he's gonna be a problem," Jimmy assumed.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Ironically, he doesn't give people problems. He's only been here a year but he stays out of people's way and usually does what he's told. He's one of the youngest. Our oldest is Samuel Del'Ahart. He's 22 and one of the best shooters I've seen in my year of being here."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Did you say this place was here for a year?" Jimmy asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, 13 months," Olas said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The goddamn piece of shit lied to me," Jimmy said under his breath.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Excuse me?" Olas asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Nothing, I'm just talking to myself," Jimmy answered.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well, I just wanted to introduce you to some things. Running camp two and three are Captain Corseal and Colonel Arkanine, if you know them at all and you wanted to say hi."
            </p>
            <p>
                "This isn't first grade Lieutenant, I know what I can and cannot do."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay, just makin' sure. A lot of these people are uneducated, so I have to adjust," Olas said. Jimmy gave a shy look.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay, nice meeting you then," Olas said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Again, I'm not in first grade."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Sorry." Olas walked out and down and out of the building. Jimmy knew he wasn't going to fit in.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Tutos stopped where the prison was and pressed a code.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Let's go, in there," Tutos said. Malir walked in slowly, then Tutos activated the prison again.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You know, my mission was to kill you. I already killed the President," Malir said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tutos' face was unbelievably furious.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Alright, you're an assassin right? I'm smart, I'm not falling for your mind games."
            </p>
            <p>
                "They're not mind games, I'm serious."
            </p>
            <p>
                "That will show up tomorrow." Tutos played it smart on his end and just walked out. Across the hall he saw Tooly, sleeping. Malir clenched his fist but knew he couldn't escape this prison. The electric blue bars were 10x hotter than lava, disintigrating anything that tries to pass through.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Jimmy stood, looked around his office, and then unpacked. He looked down at the furniture. It was cheap buut it'd do for the week. He examined the file of Mitch Lelely closer. There was something about him that just struck jimmy. In a few hours he'd know for himself what he felt. It was usually different from what other people thought. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The sun was peering over the horizon. It was time to awake the men. He thought being a drill Sergeant was something he just couldn't do. He was an expert in battle and he did want to show a thing or two to these men. He walked out of his office.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Wake up! Wake up!" But no one did. "Goddamnit you sacks of shit get your asses ready!"
            </p>
            <p>
                All the men awoke and quickly got ready.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I could get into this," Jimmy said to himself, and walked outside.
            </p>
            <p>
                The guards at the entrance had chnaged shift but were still groggy looking. The air was cold but the wind was light. All the men filed into the courtyard and stood in five lines of 30.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I am your new instructor. Hands at your sides!" Jimmy yelled. "You will be with me for a week. No matter how much the other officer did, you're working twice as hard when you're with me. Now, you will jog one dozen, not 11 laps, not 13 laps, 12 laps around this facility which is one half mile. Anyone stops you start over! You got that you maggots?!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Sir yes sir!" all of the men answered at once. They started to job. Jimmy watched closely.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Tutos sat in his office. His thoughts were on the ring, not sleeping. He stroked the gold curiously. He was curious to know what the orb does. He looked at his desk. Then he received a hail.
            </p>
            <p>
                "General Tutos? Admiral Benkoff wants to board Alpha. He's on my ship which is about four miles from your position."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, that's very good." Tutos was shivering. He tried to pull off the ring. It wouldn't budge.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Boarding in about two minutes, General," the voice on the other end said. 
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes." The struggle to get the ring off was underway. He just couldn't. He looked down at the ring and saw its power, then smiled. But he soon felt it ooze through him as he lookeod. It reflected through his eyes and glistened. He looked up to see there was someone at the door. It was Estolav. Tutos put his left hand into a glove and opened the door from the control panel on the desk.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Where's Tooly?" Estolav asked, walking in. "General? I know you know." Estolav came right up to the front of the desk.
            </p>
            <p>
                "In prison for going through unauthorized property."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Huh? When was this?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "While you were sleeping. I also arrested a Zyphlin assassin. He and the assassin were working together, and that warrants an arrest."
            </p>   
            <p>
                "I want proof," Estolav stated.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Check the finger prints on the cases in room 7. He forced his way in and searched," Tutos said. "You should be gone, leave in your ship. Estolav stayed.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Where the hell do you get off?" Estolav said. Benkoff was behind him. There was silence. Estolav turned.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Admiral, this is Lieutenant Estolav. He resigned some months ago but he's back here now."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Greetings," Estolav cheesily said on purpose. Tutos stood.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Admiral, if I can please say that he is out of any discussion that might take place," Tutos said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, but I would like to know more about this one," Benkoff said. Meanwhile, Tutos ordered into his comlink that Narta be woken up and immediately assigned to a camp down on Earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                "General? Tutos!" Benkoff yelled. Tutos looked up.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Look Admiral, I'm very busy and I don't have time for games. We have two major problems. You with me so far? We're trying to get the vote ready. I'm sure you heard all about the incident on Farline. Now we're beginning to train men down on Earth. We have traitors, assassins, damn Dominion on Earth too. That's just the half of it. Please stay focused. This man, Lieutenant Estolav, cannot be here for this discussion. He resigned and even when he was active caused nothing but problems. I was kind to give him refuge on my ship. But that was only until today. Sit doown with your officers and we'll talk when you get him out of here because quite frankly I'm busy and pissed. Not a good combination. So please Admiral, stay with me."
            </p>
            <p>
                Benkoff looked at Estolav and pointed to the door.
            </p>
            <p>
                "That's right, let him feed you his bullshit," Estolav said, and walked out. Down the hall was Narta.
            </p>
            <p>
                "why are you so upset?" Estolav thought it couldn't get any worse.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm training a bunch of minions. You fight with Tutos again?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yeah. Guy's a fake. He put Tooly in prison for supposedly going through an unauthorized area. He's in the prison I was in. The one you—"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yeah, I remember. Listen, I'm going to be on Earth but I'll always be there for you. I understand what you're feeling, I went through it too a few years ago. Anyway, just contact me. Don't know how, but contact me."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I will. I got to get out of this hunk of junk too." They hugged and departed from each other.

            <p>
                "Now, th candidates who are running are three men: Harvey Kenyus, a political director at Farline, Arway Hevawake, and Seth Azner. The all will make their marks in about a month. The speeches are almost prepared. So that's what I have on that. I know nothing about recruitment on Earth though, General," Benkoff stated.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We have a few of our best men training new recruits to compensate for the lives lost. These men will be good."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Good, we ned them."

                "Lap eleven! Let's go you pieces of crap! Move it!" Jimmy yelled. "My grandmother can run faster than you, and she's dead! Let's go! Duran, move your ass you sack of shit!"
            </p>

                The men filed out around the final lap. When they came back they stood firmly.

            <p>
                "Not too bad considering you look like shit out there. The best time was ten minutes. What is this, high school? No, shut up private, it's the military. IF you can't run here, you can forget it for your life! Hands at your sides. If I have to tell you one more time you're scrubbing the floors!" Jimmy yelled.

Guess what, you can wipe that idea clean from your head because it is not happening!" Jimmy yelled. The teenagers stood worried. Jimmy did too.

                "I will do that, General. But before I leave I must know something," Benkoff paused. Tutos was frightened that he was talking about the ring. "Nevermind," Benkoff said. Tutos' chest broke free from stress when Tutos and his men walked out.

                "What will happen to us now? You know your race better than I do," Malir asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We'll probably be transferred to a prison on a planet. I doubt there are any space stations around here," Tooly said. 
            </p>
            <p>
                "You guys got smarter. These bars were steel just 20 years ago," Malir said, while taking a secret blade from his booot.
            </p>
            <p>
                "A knife won't do squat to a steel bar anyway," Tooly said, but when the blade came out it was noticeably not metal. It shined blue.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What's that?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Our knives. Psi combined with electric particles and metalic powder. It works as if the target was butter and the weapon was a steak knife. Warm butter that is," Malir said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Goddamnit, how are we going to get out of here?" Tooly moaned. Malir sat.
            </p>
            <p>
                "If I can find where the generator for these containment bars is behind the wall, I can cut the stream with this knife and disrupt the generator. Otherwis the knife and stream would cross-react and most likely both disappear. But that only leaves six inches of room instead of three, and I can't fit through that small of a space without getting zapped, so to speak," Malir said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You can do all of that?" Tooly asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I take it you don't have many Zyphlin visitors?" Malir asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Correct," Tooly answered.
            </p>
            <p>
                "That's a good thing. We're on the smarter half of the existing races," Malir stated.
            </p>

            <p>
                Estolav floated through space, nothing on all four sides of his ship .It was just his mind and himself. He was thinking too hard about things, he usally did. The only place for him to go was Farline, the planet of humans. The good thing was that the human didn't know him. That's what he liked, no known history, just strolling down the streets.
            </p>
            <p>
                His thoughts were interrupted when he picked a wraith up on radar, one mile back. He knew Tutos was going to order someone to follow him. The real wonder was when, who, and how far. The fighter was gaining on him. He told himself if he was fired on, there was nothing stopping him from blowing the wraith away. Farline was close though, he would be there in a matter of minutes, but the wraith bothered him. He calculated by the time the fighter caught up to him, he would be on Farline. He was curious to know if he was sgoing to follow him on foot. He thought "yes" but the answer was yet to be discovered.

            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                "Now, your exercise will be <i>that</i>." Jimmy pointed ot a huge, complex jungle gym. "You will do that twice. Mistakes won't be welcome, you got that!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Sir, yes—"
            </p>
            <p>
                "That was a rhetorical question, shut your mouths!" Jimmy interrupted. "I want that done in ten minutes. Go! Move it!"
            </p>
            <p>
                The men ran toward the jungle gym and started the exercise down on all fours. There were stones and if you were a little bit off you'd fall into the mud, and then the instructor knew what mistake you made. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As Jimmy watched he saw a dropship above him, on its way to camp four. They were all somewhat in a circle, so the eye could see a face at any camp. It was Narta who walked out, and his crew were standing out there firmly. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Jimmy looked back at his group. Someone was down, not getting up. Jimmy ran in and knelt by the man. Rolling him over he saw that the man's eyes were closed and he wasn't moving.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Somone get a medic!" he yelled. "Stay with me, son," he continued. But there was nothing around them that he could have fallen from or tripped over. It was an 8 foot monkey bar set, which was only about a 2 foot fall. Jimmy looked back at the crew who were done and looking at them.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Medic!" and at that moment a medic came jogging in.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What happened?" the medic questioned.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't know, I just saw him on the ground."
            </p>
            <p>
                "He needs immediate assistance. I have to bring him to the ER now!" she yelled. "Help me." They both lifted him and hurried him to the ER. Corseal was in there.
            </p>
            <p>
                "One of mine is in here too," he said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why?" Jimmy asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Fell from the highest part of the obstacle course. Broke both of his legs. And your man?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't really know, I guess I will find out soon," Jimmy answered in a nervous voice.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Where's Arkanine?" Jimmy asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Running camp two, right next to you and me," Corseal stated.
            </p>
            <p>
                "So there are four camps?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "So far. They want about 24 by the end of this year," Corseal stated.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hmm. Well, I got to get back to my crew," Jimmy exposed, and walked out. He stomped hard on the ground, pacing toward his crew. When he stopped he looked at his men straight in the eyes, for several minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What happened?" he asked. There was a long pause. "My patience is at zero and I'm not willing to stand here and watch someone eget away with this. Duran, was it you? Or maybe you Hybig? Or maybe you Lelly? What do you say Mitch? Did you injur that man?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "No sir," Mitch answered.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't want anyone to think that telling me is a bad thing. That may sound stupid but I want an answer. Okay, all of you, 20 laps."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Sir, I think I can help sir," the private looked around and spotted Mitch looking straight.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It was Private Lelly sir, he popped him on the elbow then trampled him sir."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Who else saw this?" Jimmy yelled. No one raised their hands. "Everyone go in except for you Mitch!"
            </p>
            <p>
                Mitch stayed standing straight and firm.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What happened, Private? What did you do?" Jimmy asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Like I said sir, nothing," Mitch said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Okay, if you're lying expect twenty laps and then a hundred extra laps," Jimmy said. "Don't get off on the wrong foot with me."
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Estolav tore through the atmosphere of Farline, the wraith only a couple hundred yards behind.
            </p>
            <p>
                "This is Lieutenant Estolav with the Terran military forces, I need a landing pad immediately," Estolav said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Just one minute, Lieutenant," a voice shot back.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I don't have a minute!" Estolav yelled. Then he broke free from the cloud's cage and saw the city.
            </p>
            <p>
                "There is one on 64-97 code clearance, I'll translate for you, one moment."
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, I know what it means, thanks you," Estolav said, and turned a few degrees west. It was where he would land. It was on top of a 190 story building, but it was the only one around according to the planet representatives. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Estolav spotted the platform and stopped all engines. The wraith flew right past and Estolav's ship hit the pad with a hard snap. He lowered the ramp and ran out. The wraith turned around and landed on the platform too. A man jumped out and saw Estolav's ship. He crept around it and saw nothing. Estolav was behind him and put him into a headlock.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Not so tough without your ship, are ya? Who are you," and released the man. It was Lieutenant Orno.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It's Orno," he said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why were you following me?" Estolav growled.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I was told by Tutos not to kill you, just to follow you."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well you did a shitty job," Estolav stated. "Goddamn Tutos. I hate that rat."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why did you go here," Orno questioned.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It's the only place left for me. I want military out of my life. I want a family, kids, and a beauitful view of Rocky Pass, the only place left on Farline that doesn't have buildings. It's only a few miles but it's the best place in the galaxy. Have you ever been to Rocky Pass?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "No."
            </p>
            <p>
                "That explains why you're still in the military. All the high ranking officers are being assigned to the camps down on Earth, bit by bit," Estolav stated.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I know, but I'm airforce, so they need me for surveillance," Orno answered.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Go back to Tutos and say you killed me. He'll be happy with you and he won't hunt me anymore. Will you do that Lieutenant?" Estolav asked. Orno nodded. Estolav nodded back, walked back into his ship, glad that matter was off his chest. He slid into the cockpit and put his head back against the cushion. He closed his eyes and put war behind him, then took off for Rocky Pass...

            <p>
                "Carefully, Malir, you're our only hope. The guard comes in every twenty minutes. He'll be back soon," Tooly said. Malir cut the beam with his knife and all of the containment beams disappeared, but his knife was still there.
            </p>
            <p>
                "If you were anyone else, I'd leave you here to rot," Malir said. "But you're my best friend and I won't turn my back on that," Malir said, and cut the beam on Tooly's bars. They too all disappeared and the knife remained in Tooly's hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Come on, follow the shadow all the way to the docking back. I'll be right behind you," Malir whispered. And they started in the shadow.
            </p>
            <p>
                Benkoff and his officers lft Alpha on a small transport, but Tutos was glad. He could rest and look at the ring again. He loved it, he loved it.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                "Okay, everyone, back out! Now we're doing the shooting drill. First we do targts, then we do a fake bullet exercise. The person who comes in first is suad leader until someone beats that person. Rifles and sidearm are on the carts," Jimmy said. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The men rushed to the carts and gathered weapons.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The targets!" Jimmy yelled. 
            </p>
            <p>
                They put in the ammo and aimed, then when they were ready they shot. The paper targets tore apart and splattered on the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Good, now with sidearm!" Jimmy ordered. The men pulled out pistols and shot at the remains of the target in front of them. All of them were down by the end of the exercise.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Now, the fake bullet exercise. You will feel a jolt when you get shot but you will only be knocked unconcious," Jimmy yelled. They took their weapons.
            </p>
            <p>
               "Red team is A to M, blue team are the rest. You can go anywhere in a one mile radius of the obstacle course," Jimmy said . Narta's men just finished the jog when they started and Jimmy waved. Narta didn't see though.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                "Stop. I sense two men around that corner. Only a few hundred feet down this hall until we reach the docking bay," Malir whispered. "Just be quiet passed this hallway, and follow me."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm right with you," Tooly answered, in a whisper as well. They tip toed passed the hall and there were two men, just as Malir thought. They both blended into the one foot shadow but a mistake could easily be made that would cost the lives of both of them. They weren't moving fast, they couldn't move fast. They had to side step back against the wall and stay on their toes to prevent noise. Any noise at all was a danger.
            </p>
            <p>
                Soon they passed the west hall. The dockin bay was just down the way. Malir lifted his fingers and ended up pointing to the docking bay.

            <p>
                "This is the hard part. Once we get on a ship, there's not going to be a problem," Malir whispered. They crept silently.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Jimmy looked over the exercise with open eyes. Two men on the blue team were down but nearly 40 on the red team were down. Red men crept around the corner and took our three blue men. They fell, shaking, turning all about. They moved through the maze quietly but a squad of 30 heard the gun shots and stumbled into the poistion. Jimmy knew if the red assassins were to be caught, they would die. They were one collumn over going north and south. They got past the 30 blue but then had a duel with ten, and the 30 heard. They sprinted back to the ten members of their team when red ambushed them and flanked the ten other blue. 40 blue fell to their deaths when more red came in for support. 30 red filed and followed the existing ten red. The existing blue were now trapped in a corner, with only 30 of the men left. The red broke off into two grooups of 15 and tried to flank the blue, but the blue were expecting it and put up a good battle.
            </p>
            <p>
                The blue still lost and the red yelledi n victory. Jimmy made his way down the hill to congratulate the red and give the award to squad leader to whom earned it. Then, the men who "died" before stood up and limped over to where Jimmy stood in front of the surviving 25 red.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Out of the twent five of you left, who's the one who kept you alive and was the quote on quote leader?" Jimmy questioned. All of the men together said "Duran." Duran was African American. Not tall or built, but fast and sly.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You shall be squad leader. For now," Jimmy said. He shook Duran's hand and headed for a goldn pin the size eof a thumb nail.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm honored, Captain Raynor," Duran spoke smoothly, and smiled. The red team yelled and cheered, and the blue team gave snarled and foul expressions.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                "On my count, you go. I'll be right at your side the whole way in. But, if we're seen, move to the ship faster. You said you knew the code clearance for that little green one?" Malir whispered.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You fly. I hate navigation. Once we get out of tractor beam range of the ship, take us into warp speed so they can't track us. The won't follow us," Malir stated. Tooly nodded and they were off. Their legs were tense but for the most part they looked normal. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Repair men made up most of the docking bay populaiton but a few marines patrolled as well. Rifles out and everything. Tooly and Malir were boarding the ramp when someone yelled "stop!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Just keep going," Malir said in a rushy like voice. Tooly sat in the cockpit and saw marines running toward Malir. Malir jumped on and Tooly raised the ramp. They started the engines after a quick punch-in of a code on the dash.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Take us out of here!" Malir yelled. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The small green ship turned, close-lining a marine, splitting him in half. They drifted through space a darn high speed. Too high for the ship to handle. But after they saw that they were being followed, they kept the speed.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Wraiths!" Tooly called.
            </p>

            <p>
                He swerved the ship handle and it jerked to the left. The two wraiths easily followed the ship turn and prepared missiles.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Fire!" 
            </p>
            <p>
                Four missiles made their way to the small green ship.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Crap, missiles on us tight," Tooly yelled.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What do you want me to do about it?" Malir stood, unsure of what to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The speed on this thing sucks!" Tooly moaned.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You picked a good ship to know the code clearance for!" Malir yelled back. Tooly looked at the engines dial, it was critical and the missile was still gaining on them.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Ahhhh!" Tooly yelled as the missiles reached 0 meters on radar. "Our back is melting!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "They're that close?!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes, they're that close!" Tooly yelled.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Go faster!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I can't, the engines will explode!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Tooly! The engines will stall and shield will be up, just do it!"
            </p>
            <p>
                Tooly put trust in his friend and jammed the navigation stick forward.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Critical, slow down. Critical, slow down," the ship's computer repeated. "Critical systems alert. Critical systems alert."
            </p>
            <p>
                Malir walked up to the computer and put his fist throughh the control screen before she could say it again. The systems stalled and the missiles hit. Tooly covered his head. Not all of his trust was with Malir. But the shields were only down 50%.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You did it! How did you know!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Hold on, it's going to take a few minutes for the engines to cool down, so this is what I need for you to do. Take this map and get out of here," Malir said, and walked over ot the other side of the cockpit and accessed the release button.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What? Where are you going to go?" Tooly questioned.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Stay here, and have the ships not follow you," Malir answered, and handed him a laser pistol from the dash.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The planet you're going to land on is vicious, you'll need this."
            </p>
            <p>
                "You'll die up here," Tooly said.
            </p>
            <p>
                "We both will die if we both stay up here," Malir stated.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I'm sure we can fit two people in that escape pod," Tooly hoped.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Look, barely you could fit in that thing. I checked it out already. Just go, okay? Go!"
            </p>
            <p>
                Tooly left the cockpit without a word and got in the escape pod. Then he sat. He didn't want to press the red button, he didn't want to leave Malir behind. But he knew Malir was right, and pressed the red button in a nonchalant focus.
            </p>
            <p>
                He felt a click and then an immediate jolt. He drifted back, and soon the little green ship faded away. He didn't know what to think of now, the safety of how and where he would land wasn't even of notice.
            </p>

                "Gee wiz, Duran is it?" Jimmy questioned.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Yes sir."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Well, you should be glad. You will lead them tomorro. I see they respect you, and that's what is so good to me. It makes me like ya even more," Jimmy said. Duran smiled.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Good job today, Private, I—" but the sound of a throating engine muffled Jimmy's words. Both of them, along wit hthe whole crew, turned to see that a dropship had begun landing.
            </p>
            <p>
                "All camps are full, I plead to know who these guys and gals are now," Jimmy said. Only Duran heard.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ramp lowered and the curiosity of all the men rose, higher than ever. The thing walked out.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What the..." Jimmy couldn't believe what he was seeing. A 6'4" armored thing. It had the shape and walk like a human, but the armor was far too advanced, for the eyes of anyone. The armor was green, the helmet was too. Gold sealed the visor color.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Who are you?" Jimmy asked, but the figure kept its pace and walked directly past him. Jimmy would normally speak up but the sight of the new thing was amazing. He was a head lower than the armored person and Jimmy didn't like that at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I order you to speak. Speak or you'll be fired upon," Jimmy frustratingly said. The figure turned.
            </p>
            <p>
                "What do you want to know?" It spoke English and had a human relation vocal cord. 
            </p>
            <p>
                "Good, we're on the same page. Where did  you come from and why are you here?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I cannot answer the first question
