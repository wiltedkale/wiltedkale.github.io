        <h2><span style="font-size:1.4rem";>1994 - I'm 4</span></span></h2>
        <p class="drop cap">
            I hated public restrooms but sometimes it's either that or shit your pants/explode so we pulled off the highway and into a gas station. My mom got the key from the foreign guy. I couldn't talk to people so I just followed her around, to the side of the building where there was an external door (bad sign). My mom unlocked the door and I walked in.
        </p>
        <p>
            It sucks trying to work out your constipated turds in a room that was hit by a nuke, but this one was. Every public bathroom was so bad but this was one of the first ones—part of an early group of bathrooms that created a kind of trauma. I quickly developed a condition where I'd just hold it in for days, over a week sometimes, because I was too afraid to be that vulnerable. And when I finally did go it came out like a brick, millimeter by millimeter, like a submarine coming out of two couch cushions. It was very painful.
        </p>
        <p>
            I ended up just peeing instead. I couldn't shit here. If I was too stressed or vulnerable the poo wouldn't come out. Same with urinals. I sucked at tests too.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was like a locker room at a public pool. Only this one had rancid shit mixed in. And on the floor too. There was at least an inch of water on the floor in some parts, but other parts were somehow fine. There was toilet paper floating in the bad parts. I had to shit but maybe I needed to vomit. Maybe I would vomit shit. I hadn't even seen the worst, yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            The toilet was the eye of the storm. Inside was an unflushable mass of TP and excrement that had risen to the seat. As my pee hit, it felt like me and the guy who left it there were touching. I felt betrayed by this guy, really. FLUSH. I had an image of this guy with long greasy hair and ugly teeth, selling drugs. I saw him with a switchblade, violently swinging it at people. At 4 I thought these were bad things.
        </p>
        <p>
            The soap dispenser was empty so I just ran straight out of there. My mom returned the key, then checked out with 10 bucks of coffee and snacks—little Entenmann's shits we always ate, hydrogenated crapola. We belted up. She passed my brother the bag of crapola and we were back on route 95.
        </p>
        <p>
            My mom tore open the package of a Devil Dog with her teeth, went hard into it. It looked like she was eating my shit.
        </p>
        <div align="center";>&#42 &#42 &#42</div>
        <p>
            I stared out the window and watched the cars. I started to see some repeats. My brother was in the front seat with his feet on the dash, shoes off, mashing the buttons on his Game Gear. His mouth hung half open as he kicked ass, or got his ass kicked, in Mortal Kombat II.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wonder what my mom was thinking about. Stuff wasn't going so good on the money front and her friend Nancy was going to help, I guess. I just sat there with a runny nose and stared at the road lines, impressed by how fast they were going by. My brother sat up there with his Game Gear, squeaked little farts out, grunted, took a sip of his soda. This was my mom's problem, we were just along for the paid vacation. We were in Connecticut, I knew that.
        </p>
        <p>
            My mom put on her blinker. We had seen so many people turn off while we kept going, now it was our turn. We turned off and everyone else kept going. I was glad because my ass and back hurt and I still needed to crap pretty bad. The commercial stuff was behind us, this new road was narrow and had tall trees on either side. It was late Autumn so only the pine needles were left. The yards were big and came all the way to the road. The houses were old.
        </p>
        <p>
            My brother read off the directions for the final few turns. He was good at it, like he was leading us back home. We slowed down, leaned over to check the numbers on the mailbox. This was it. My mom turned the wheel and pulled our old Plymouth rustbucket down the long skinny driveway. When we got to the end there was a lady standing there.
        </p>
        <div align="center";>&#42 &#42 &#42</div>
        <h2><span style="font-size:1.2rem";></span></h2>
        <p>
            I climbed out of the van, closed the slider door myself—pulled as hard as I could with both hands. The thing was a hundred pounds. We lined up and my mom introduced me and my brother to Nancy. Nancy introduced us to her son, Michael. Michael said hi. My brother said hi back. I didn't say anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            Michael seemed alright from the start. He was soft spoken and kind. He loved video games. His mom could cook. He played video games and ate his mom's cooking. This was the circle of life.
        </p>
        <p>
            While my mom talked with Nancy about grown up stuff, Michael led me and my brother into the basement. Older people didn't like the basement because it took effort to go down and come up again, and was generally shitty and uncomfortable, so it was a place for kids to go and play, hide out. It was cheap, infertile land. We used it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our moms' voices trailed off as they went one way and we went another. When we got to the bottom of the stairs we saw another kid, Jimmy, sitting on the carpet facing the TV. He was waiting for Michael to unpause the game. He was much more interested in the game than us. We just stood there breathing the basement must in, waiting for these dudes to show us how it's done. We didn't expect much. Michael pushed a button on his controller and the TV unfroze, and with it the music. The music was a jet engine. It sent us back 5 feet and dropped us on our ass.
        </p>
        <p>
            I looked up: Michael and Jimmy were really digging in, ramming their jeeps into each other at full speed. Jimmy jammed into first but took the next ramp at an angle, flew off the track and exploded. 
        <p>
            "DAMMIT," Jimmy fumed. It handed Michael the lead.
        </p>
        <p>   
            The game was beautiful, my eyes were glued to the screen. My brother's too.  
        </p>
        <p>
            "You guys never played <b><a href="rocknroll.html">Rock n' Roll Racing<sup>1</sup></a></b>?" asked Michael.
        </p>
        <p>
            We hadn't, but why hadn't we. This was way better than anything we were doing before. It changed everything.
        </p>
        <p>
            A flurry of missiles connected with Michael's car and it exploded.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You wanna try?" he asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            I saw Michael pass my brother the controller in slow motion. The start of a new chapter, the end of the old shitty one.
        </p>

            4 hours into a Rock n' Roll marathon Nancy's husband John, the human megaphone, yelled down into the basement. 
        </p>
        <p>
            "DINNER!!1!1"
        </p>
        <p>
            We hadn't met John yet and frankly that was alright. He worked all day, came home, made his presence known, went to sleep, did it over again. He wore oval glasses and was bald on top. He looked like a bad guy, a villain. He looked like a serial killer. He scared me.
        </p>
        <p>
            "LIGHTS OFF IN THE BASEMENT!"
        </p>
        <p>
            We turned the bottoms of our socks black sliding around the house. We slid into the kitchen. I was starving. I wanted what the moms made. Italian gravies that turned you into an animal, found you a good 30 minutes before dinner was ready and hung there, slowly ramping up, layering in. Man.
        </p>
        <p>
            I swung my legs back and forth under my chair. I was already comfortable here. My brother, too. He was smiling. We all were. Except John. John had to work all day so he didn't smile. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I didn't understand why John was there. What did he DO!? (he was an engineer) He seemed so out of place. While we all had fun he was missing. And when he was there he was so serious. His voice was deep and he projected it in a cone.
        </p>
        <p>
            "LIGHTS OFF IN THE BASEMENT!"
        </p>
        <p>
            We were ready to fork in the spagetti but there was still one empty seat at the table. It was Will, Michael's older brother. It was always Will. Probably finishing up a game. It was tough to get him to the table, he just wanted to play Warcraft all day. We watched him play sometimes, Warcraft was sweet.
        </p>
        <div align="center";>&#42 &#42 &#42</div>
        <h2><span style="font-size:1.2rem";></span></h2>
        <p>
             Nancy spent an hour cleaning up, then their side peeled off to watch X-Files. The TV shone into the hallway, their backs to us, taking in all that stuff just before bed. I slowly walked by and peered in, caught a few seconds of a scene, an army General cutting into his scrambled eggs and deep red blood pouring out. That was it for me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I got into my jammies. I was top bunk with a bunch of Michael's retired stuffed animals. I stared at them. They stared back. I looked away. I peered over the top of the frame and listened to my mom read us James and the Giant Peach. In this, a kid is abused by his Aunts but manages to escape out to sea, from England to N Y C, and make friends with a bunch of oddballs. With my mom reading, the book played like a movie in my head, written by her and directed by me. She enunciated and did the voices. She did the Roald justice.
        </p>
        <p>
            My mom could have put us to bed and poured herself a glass of wine, drank the whole bottle. She could have read a book of her own, or chatted with Nancy, or just sat in front of the TV, or taken the minivan out into the blizzard and drove herself into a ditch.
        </p>
        <div align="center";>&#42 &#42 &#42</div>
        <h2><span style="font-size:1.2rem";></span></h2>
        <p>
             One second it was night time, the very next second it was morning. I'd turn on one side, close my eyes, and feel the weight of the day lift off the ground. As I drifted, a group of balloons were taking off and I grabbed onto them, floated up until I didn't feel anymore, and it was all black, and I was asleep.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was awake again. My eyes opened to grey daylight that had soaked through the blinds. I remembered where I was. I climbed down the bunk, passed my brother who was still asleep, took little steps over to the window. I could tell there was snow out there from the amount of glare alone. The question was how much. I had a good feeling about it. I looked through the blinds.
        </p>
        <p>
            I ran back over and collapsed into my brother's bed, shook him awake. Rocked him back and forth by his exposed arm. He stirred, moved his face away from his drool puddle, found himself.
        </p>
        <p>
            The two of us summoned Michael. It was dark. All the other doors in the house were closed. It was just the three of us. We zipped up and went out the kitchen slider. Michael took the lead. 
        </p>
        <p>
             "And that's where Will fell off and had to get seven stitches in his arm."
        </p>
        <p>
            "And that's where a deer died and we had to call to get it taken away."
        </p>
        <p>
            My brother raised his arm and pointed.
        </p>
        <p>
            "And what about that?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "That's just a tree."
        </p>
        <p>
            We plowed the snow in from different angles, stacked it up and packed it in. I packed some onto the side and my brother smoothed it out. Michael seemed to have the most practice. He coolly made a smooth wall on his side, then helped us with ours. He was one of these guys that would be quiet and do a good job. When we were all but finished Michael gave our structure a small window. It gave us an idea. We used sticks as rifles and played Soldiers. It was 2v1, with the 1 in the pillbox and the 2 trying to attack. But we couldn't agree on when our shots connected.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I GOT YOU!"
        </p>
        <p>
            "No, NO, it missed."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I HIT YOU LIKE FIVE TIMES, YOU'RE DEAD."
        </p>
        <p>
            "NO, NO, NOOOOOOOOOO—"
        </p>
        <p>
            We shrugged it off, walked toward the treeline at the very back of the property. I looked into the woods, felt good. Aside from the blabber mouths, it was deafeningly quiet. I just wanted to be still. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Then my brother threw a grenade from downtown. It exploded against my collar and dripped down. He'd gone too far. You're not supposed to DO that. I turned to face him. I wanted to fully send it, take aim and go off like a ball machine. But I was overdressed and had the flexibility of the Tin Man. So I dropped to my knees, scooped one together and heaved it. My brother sidestepped it with ease. I did it again but used my whole body to send it this time. It soared, curved in. I swear, it even made a sound. It hit my brother like a bag of kitty litter. It was satisfying. Something I did actually worked. I had drawn blood. It made my brother competitive.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was all out. The battle went from Revolutionary War style to Vietnam. We had traded shots but now all bets were off. We just started hurling it. It didn't look pretty but screw it, you were just trying to connect. But damn, I didn't have aim or velocity. I eventually found an opening and lobbed one in. It dropped on my brother's head like birdshit. Then he locked onto me, fired one into my ribs. I put my hand up just in time to block another. He closed in. It was over.
        </p>
        <div align="center";>&#42 &#42 &#42</div>
        <p>
            My mom was spread out at the kitchen table. She spent so much time poring over papers, usually while on the phone. The piles of papers multiplied and just kept extending out. Countertops and tables got covered with a kind of blight. She looked up from her sea of documents as I came back through the slider. I was Han returning to the Rebel base. Michael and my brother were still out there, battling Wampas.
        </p> 
        <p> 
            I waved, peeled off my snowy layers down to my long johns. My socks were wet and hung off the end of my feet. I pulled them off, left them there for someone else. Bread and jelly were already out, I grabbed the peanut butter and made the Holy Trinity. A morning PB&J to fuel the day. Mom had some news. 
        </p>
        <p>
            "Hey, Eri..."
        </p>
        <p>
            I made my sandwich but my mom would have to cut the crusts off.
        </p>
        <p>
            I heard my mom talking, heard her say "karate". I looked over. KARATE?
        </p>
        <p>
            Then suddenly imagined it: being an ace, kicking people off buildings, beating everybody up like Arnold from Terminator 2. I liked pretending to be other people, this was good. I bunched up the plastic on the loaf of bread and spun it around, tied it off.
        </p>
        <p>
            In karate I didn't even earn yellow, the very first belt upgrade. I just did some hiyas and watched a guy with an overgrown mustache tell us what to do. I was four.
        </p>
        <p>
            But there was also this weird thing at the gym, a random set of stairs with no purpose. It was just five or six steps that fell straight off. My brother called it the Stairs to Nowhere. This was the highlight. Karate was pointless but these stairs...we walked up and down, my brother in the lead. Nobody paid much attention.  Not even mustache man minded. We were rulers of this place that nobody cared about. The Stairs to Nowhere, just like the basement, was ours.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was cold and dark when karate ended. We packed into my mom's old minivan and drove back home.

            When we got in, Will was playing Warcraft. It was an intense one versus one. We crowded around the monitor. It was Orcs vs Humans, Will played Orc. He was playing over the internet against some other kid who was sitting at his computer, hundreds of miles away.
        </p>
        <p>
            I saw Will move his mouse and press something on his keyboard. His guys moved across the screen. They had green skin and mohawks. They threw spears. They roared and swung huge weapons. Orcs were awesome. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Will's Orc army clashed with the other kid's Human one.
        </p> 
        <p>
            "Dork," said Will. The kid retreated with his footmen. It was beautiful. I was stunned.
        </p>
        <p>
            I later learned that the same people who made Warcraft made Rock n' Roll Racing. I wouldn't have been able to take the news at the time. I wouldn't have been able to understand it.

            Dinner was always good but this one was different. My mom had to move her papers this time. The blight receded. It was an Italian/American/German feast celebrating the great relationship white Americans always had with indigenous people. It's a great story and one that we celebrated every November. Amen. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Right after Thanksgiving, Nancy surprised us with a Boston Cream Pie for my brother's 9th birthday. She walked it over to the ktichen table, sensitive little candy cane candles flickering to death. We were all feeling good but my brother stood out. His smile showed real teeth.
        </p>
        <p>
            He was kneeling on his chair, leaning over the table into the Boston Cream Pie, his face orange from the light. He made a wish.

            The snow kept coming. It was a real winter's winter, a boy's winter. It kept the snowball fights and the sledding and the treks into the back woods rolling. There were 5 boys in the house and we were all friends. I was the youngest by far but it didn't matter, we were all pals. Five, fifteen, whatever.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was a time to remember and it only existed because our life was off the rails. We were off the trail and had found something hidden. The trail is shit, the jungle is everything.
        </p>

        <h2><span style="font-size:1.4rem";>1995 - I'm 5</span></h2>
        <p>
            I came into the kitchen and saw my mom making some cinnamon raisin toast. She didn't seem terribly happy. The table was clear. No more papers. Something was different but I wasn't sure what. I was freshly 5 so had to be told most things. My mom spread fake butter on her toast, saw I was there, said hello. She had 2 slices, gave me 1. We sat down to eat and she told me what was going on. I swung my legs back and forth under the chair. She laid it out that we were leaving soon.
        </p>    
        <p>
            We lived at Nancy's for months but there were adult issues sprouting up like phone bills, other bills. Maybe they couldn't support three extra people living in their house forever. We had overstayed our welcome so it was back on the road.
        </p>
        <p>
            Back in '93 my mom inherited the family home in the divorce, something close to 3,000 square feet. Shortly after the divorce my mom rented it out for income. When you're on the road with your two kids, low on cash, desperate, people tend to care a lot. If you're in a big white house, people don't care. This was my mom's strategy: get people to care. In her eyes it was survival.
        </p>
        <p>
            So we needed a place to live. There was no way it was going to top Nancy's but Nancy's was a gift, one we didn't deserve. Now it was back to reality. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My mom had something lined up that she wasn't crazy about. We drove there with a packed car. It felt like the old days when we'd go into New York City for my brother's commercials. Long road trips with my mom at the wheel, my brother in the front, me in the middle. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We ended up pulling into a shelter in Flemington, New Jersey.
        </p>

        <p>
            This place was loaded with women fleeing their husbands, all of whom were more desperate than us. But we managed to slide in. The house was big, with a kitchen for group meals and a random volley ball net outside by the road, over some blacktop. As poor as it seemed it was all we had so we used it.
        </p>
        <p>
            My brother set up the Super Nintendo. I watched him play Zelda, Donkey Kong, and a bunch of the obscure ones like Super Battle Tank 2. I could watch my brother play single player games for hours. I was no good so he played. He was great. I sat next to him as he smashed the buttons. The screen lit up our faces. When the game started, we were gone—sitting in cheap crap chairs, my brother controlling his character, me asking him questions about the game, he only sometimes answering—eyes glazed over, mouth slightly open like an old person at a nursing home. It crushed reality. We were taking a hard pass on that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ocasionally we'd spot a spider the size of a golf ball ball blast across the floor. I don't know how we slept. One advantage of the top bunk was maybe they'd attack my brother first and I could escape through the ceiling.

            We were in this place for 90+ days. The first 60 went pretty fast. Time flies when you spend most of it in your head. But my mom was fighting for an extension. God help us. Was this really the best we could do? I continued to watch my brother play Zelda: A Link to the Past. If only it linked us to Nancy's. My brother went on playing Super Nintendo while I watched. We both waited to be older. Surely it got better. Cooler stuff, more freedom. My brother whacked pixelated bushes to see what was inside, dodged a slow moving arrow. He disappeared inside a building that had beautiful harp music playing. We just stayed in the room and listened for a while. Who made this? They were out there somewhere, living the life. I wanted to be one. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We eventually got hungry and went looking for the kitchen where several of the ladies were having lunch. They had prepared many boxes of Kraft Mac n Cheese, the skinny tube macaroni, and put it all in a ginormous white bowl. And on a big plate to the side, boiled hot dogs. The mac n cheese was for people who weren't going to touch the sauerkraut. Like us kids/sane people. It probably would have done me some good but it stank and looked gross. I played it safe. I shoveled in the Kraft Mac like it was my ticket out of there.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were toddlers at the shelter, too. Children of single moms and most likely arsehole fathers. We never met any of the fathers, just the moms. That was the point of this place. These women had no money and their only friends lived at the shelter. You look at their kids and figure they have no chance. But then you think the same about yourself and realize it's not so bad. Maybe they became artists or therapists. Maybe they became drug addicts and murderers. All depends on which way the wind is blowin.
        </p>
        <p>
            After our 30 day extension we left the shelter and were gone from that place for good.

            We were on the road again. Me in the back again. The slider door had a mind of its own and would randomly lock and then unlock, over and over. We were sure we had a ghost. What we really had was a shitty old van.
        </p>
        <p>
            It wasn't a long drive this time. Roughly what it took to get to the mall. I didn't know where we were but it had to be better than the last one. We pulled into a small parking lot off route 206. It looked normal. Two story building, brown. It wasn't an office but it wasn't a house either. I thought the whole thing was going to be ours. I opened the slider door, jumped out, saw the great pine trees that were there. My brother broke off, I followed. My mom knew she had lost us, we were no good in an administrative engagement anyway. We looked up at the trees. They were perfect. My brother scaled first, me a good 2 or 3 branches below. Suddenly we were 15, 20 feet up. We were completely hidden. We could have stayed up there long term. We thought about it.
        <p>
            We called this guy Willy the Wiggly. He gave us the keys. For some reason we moved a bunch of our shit in from storage instead of finding a furnished place. As if we were going to stay. It made no sense, but here we were. None of it made sense but it was fun enough. Better than same old same old. It was life at the back of a whipping tail. 
        </p>

            Our 17-inch TV went on a plastic thing with wheels that might have cost 50 cents. We set up the VCR so we could have something to do at night. We put in The Terminator. My mom didn't want us watching Braveheart but The Terminator was OK...????...It was all the Arnie scenes, how his body slowly got worse and worse as the movie went on. That scene at the police station when he just kept coming, blowing people away...or when he poked his own eye out because it was so mutilated it would have given him away as a robot.
        </p>
        <p>
            My brother and I sat there in a cluttered mess and watched. We weren't doing anything else but watching. In 1995 you did 1 goddamn thing at a time. My mom was passed out on the couch, snoring like a wildebeast. The actual ruckus of the movie kept her asleep. If we shut it off she'd wake up. Did she even see this movie? It's WAY darker than Braveheart. Only later did I find out what she thought was so bad about Braveheart. It's the scene where young Mel Gibson finds the barn full of kids who were hanged. That's what pushed her over the edge. Not the part where he took an animal horn and ran it through the English dude's neck.
        </p>
        <p>
            We spent the Summer there. The highlight was always when my dad came to pick us up for the weekend. He worked a corporate job. His ID badge was on a retractable thing on his waist. He looked good. He was in his prime. We went to the movies and saw stuff that was over my head. Stuff he and even my brother liked but I had no clue. I couldn't follow movies, I just absorbed them at face value. I never followed the plot or knew what the hell was going on but I watched every second of every one. Except for The Terminator and some other ones. I followed those well enough. It was about the main character. I needed to know what he was after.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our time off, my brother and I climbed the pine trees. No matter where we were, we were real kids together. We were eager and didn't give a crap about what was going on. All this stuff was my mom's problem. We couldn't help her anyway, we were dead weight. So we just did our thing. It didn't matter what the circumstances were, we made a path.

        <p>
            Later that Summer we found a rental in Hopewell, New Jersey—the best town in all. It was an actual town. It was very old so had kind of a European vibe. Business was small, everything was. It didn't have a lot but it had it all. We were about to find out.
        </p>
        <p>
            I opened the back slider door of my mom's old Plymouth and hopped out. The doors clanked shut one by one. We were standing before our new home, a real aged majesty. Our landlord, an old guy who looked like he could go at any minute but still wore a big smile, appeared out of the front door to greet us. He chatted with my mom while I hit a skinny stick against the ground. I hit the stick into the ground over and over, same spot, slowly making a little hole in the dirt. Then he showed us inside. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It was an 18th century duplex, with bone dry floorboards that whined everytime you took a step. There was no sneaking up on anyone. There were downsides to the place like the attic, it was pretty scary. It was also buggy. So many bugs but none helping with the rent. Still, this place was like a little piece of home we broke off from Nancy's that was finally catching up with us.
        </p>
        <p>
            We walked through each room, downstairs then upstairs. Our guy knocked on the wall, telling us we shared that with our neighbor. We shared the yard, too. It was enough space and it was ours, for now. As a duplex, it had character. It was asymmetrical. A little Tim Burton. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The old guy, still smiling, still very old, handed us the keys. It was time for us to move our crap in. My brother and I went straight for the Super Nintendo—the box that we packed ourselves that said SNES in our handwriting, TOYS AND GAMES in our mom's. Toys and games? Toys and games could be anything. It was EVERYTHING. We had to be more specific. The TV was 1,000,000,000 pounds but with the two of us we somehow managed it. My brother reached into the SNES box and grabbed the F-connector, what we used to hook the Nintendo up to the TV. With an F-connector you have to guide this pin-sized male end into a milimeter sized female end. Then screw it on the rest of the way. It was hard. My brother was good at it.
        <p>
            We put the Rock n' Roll Racing cartridge into the Nintendo and turned the TV to channel 3. If 3 showed static we messed something up/were screwed, but if we got a dark blueish screen with some noise and blips, we were good to go. I held my breath. We got it. We got the blueish screen.
        </p>

        <p>
            I was entered into Kindergarten and my brother 4th grade. Hopewell really had it. People were nice. I got along with everyone. We loved the same things and didn't fight. There was nothing to fight over yet. We enjoyed the milk while someone else tended to the cow. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The people in your town were your friends and your whole world. The people the next town over didn't even exist. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The air smelt like fresh cut grass and moist dirt. I breathed it in, got a good pull, rose up into the air 15, 20 feet, glided. Life was a painting. This is what life is supposed to be.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every morning I walked to school, every afternoon I walked home. Down North Greenwood Avenue, up a hill and over the steep bridge where the train tracks ran underneath. The trains weren't running at the time but they could have been. They should have been. It would have been the cherry on top. It was only about a mile to school but you passed so much on the way. To live a mile from everything, to walk everywhere. These are invaluable qualities of life.
        </p>
        <p>
            I walked with a couple of friends. They had nice hair and wore nice clothes. They smiled a lot, showing off their dimples. They played soccer. They grew up and changed their names to Norman, moved to Boring, and shat themselves to sleep. But for now they were my friends. They stopped and got a bagel with cream cheese every day. I got nothing every day. I waited for them and we walked the rest of the way to school.

        <p>
            Hopewell people extracted the flavors of the month. The real test was when old people cared about young people stuff, like Halloween. Years later Halloween would feel like a formality but in 1995 it was a real thing. There was authenticity back then. Things had meaning. Meaning exists when people say it does, and most people wanted there to be a lot of meaning so there was...
        </p>
        <p>
            Big swaths of little goblins ran through the street, pumpkin candy buckets flying. Every house had something else going on, there wasn't a single dark one in the whole town. People existed, in flesh and blood. Even the grownups had fun. They wanted to participate. They unleashed their kids into the night and stayed behind to serve other people's kids. In the weeks and months leading up, they had gone overboard with decorations and spooky booby traps, awesome stuff like severed bodies spilling out from under the house, an arm reaching out to grab you. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I ran up to the door, stepped on the welcome mat between two costumed statues. I rang the bell. FDKNGERNERNGEGNKDHGNKDMSDLMG. The statues moved. I flew backwards onto my ass. The statues looked at each other. A lady, dressed normal, opened the door and gave me an extra piece of candy.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had to be more careful. The town was alive, crawling with one-night performances. We had signed up for this haunted house when we put the mask on. Candy came at a cost. If I weren't so constipated I'd have shit my pants.
        </p>
        <p>
            Burton Ave. I was blocks away from home, in parts of the town I had never seen. It was barely 8:00 but I had scowered Heaven and Hell, shown off my costume to millions. Time was being stretched from a dough. Minutes here were like hours on any other good day. The night would go on forever, and yet it would all be over far too soon.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was focused on the here and now. I was dressed up for Halloween but wasn't pretending to be someone else. I was already the best I would ever be. I didn't know it but didn't need to. I thought we were all OK. Actually, I didn't even think about it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I ran from house to house with my pillowcase, dropping candy in one by one. Trampling the yards. Cape flowing behind.

            In Kindergarten you were either AM or PM. I was PM. I radared in to the table that had a winter scene set up and a bunch of toy cars. A little girl joined in but she didn't know how to play. People moved the cars too fast, or raised them in the air and like flew them around. WHAT ARE YOU DOING. I had to leave. I went over to the carpet, sat down, spread my legs, and moved my feet in a windshield wiper motion. I did this for more than 20 minutes. Then my friend Gus joined in. We talked about cartoons.
        </p>
        <p>
            My mom took us to Disney World for three full weeks in December. Most parents would never do this but my mom knew what was important. I remember Disney more than two extra weeks of Kindergarten.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everyone knows about Disney and it sucks now, so I'm not going to talk about it. Yea yea, Space Mountain. I found Hershey Park to be way better. It was less than an hour away. The only problem with Hershey is that I was on the ride where they show you how the chocolate's made and I dropped my candy. It was an epic multicolored piece I had barely touched. I cried. It ruined the ride.
        </p>
        <p>
            After three weeks at Disney I returned to Kindergarten with a fresh coat of paint. I was a new man. I was the king of the room when I walked in. After three weeks I felt two years older. I walked into class with gelled hair, sunglasses and a blazer. I moved a toothpick between my teeth. I looked at kids confidently. I shot them with a finger pistol. I had stepped away for a second and it gave me something. I was ready for anything. It was time for show and tell.
        </p>
        <div align="center";>&#42 &#42 &#42</div>
        <p>
            I knelt on the couch and looked out the window, barely able to see the street through the chonkiness of the flakes. Like they were cut out of construction paper. God's bad dandruf, the angels' intense pillow fight, etc. The type that started sticking almost immediately because the ground was so cold. The snow just started piling up.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any old dusting was cool but a blizzard blew the top straight off. It's because we knew school was going to be closed. You couldn't plow this. It's like wiping your hands after every rib. Let it go, let it pile up. Close the schools. Close everything. Find your new purpose in the snow. And we did. The recess was forming right outside the window. As it accumulated my brother and I played Mortal Kombat II. Raiden vs Liu Kang. Scorpion vs Sub Zero. We had a little extra pep, bounced on the soles of our feet. We played better than we usually did, more clean. All thanks to the snow. You play better when you're feeling good.
        </p>    
        <p>  
            Now it was Scorpion vs Liu Kang. We were both trying to do the cheap moves over and over. My brother finished me off with the third repeater kick in a row. If he would just stop playing so CHEAP. I dropped the controller, looked outside. My brother shut off the Super Nintendo.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Let's go," he said.
        </p>
        <p>
            We were Han and Luke, going out into Hoth. The snow was really dumping on us. No roads, no sidewalks, no bullshit. I exited the back door and was tranquilized by the calm white plane. Like it was the '20s or something. When it came down like this, things just kind of shut up for a minute. The world became a canvas wiped clean for you to draw fresh stuff on.
        </p>
        <p>
            First stop was the frozen canopy just behind our house, little skiny branches that came all the way to the ground and caccooned us, forged a path all the way to the brook. The brook was frozen solid, created a bridge to the other side. All around was a fantasy wilderness populated by solo-traveling wizards, barbarians, rangers on horseback, little caravans of townspeople. A wolf howled in the distance, a campfire wafted in. This wasn't Hopewell in 1996, it was Middle Earth. There was no evidence to the contrary.
        </p>
        <p>
            My brother and I looped around, dragging the sled all the way home. We were hungry. We wanted mom's dinner, then we were going to start a fresh game of Rock n' Roll racing. We had our plan for the evening and it felt good. It always felt good to have a solid plan and look ahead at it. Just to relish in it. 
        </p>
        <div align="center";>&#42 &#42 &#42</div>
        <p>
            There was a room in the house we didn't use, just plopped our ugly pink couches into. We never used the pink couches, only the beige ones. For some reason we had two sets (Italian mom). So I used it to dance to the Reptile theme from Mortal Kombat. It was my favorite movie and the best scene was when Reptile fought Liu Kang. I loved it when Reptile was kicking Liu Kang's ass because Reptile was cool and Liu Kang was boring. But it's a movie so halfway through the fight, after getting kicked through a four foot brick wall and smashed in the head twenty times, Liu starts winning. If I were making the movie, I'd have Reptile snap Liu's neck then go and beat up Johnny and Sonya, who were just standing there watching. I'd just have Reptile snapping necks and ripping spines, eating everyone's guts. Then maybe Raiden stops him but probably not. Reptile was the coolest. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I watched Mortal Kombat over and over, until it was burned into my brain. I had my mom buy me the soundtrack. I'd put the CD in and seek to the right part, then mosh my brains out. I bounced into and off the ugly pink couches, kicking ass.
        </p> 
        <p>  
            I was rewriting the movie my way, with Reptile as the star. In my movies, the badass villains win.

            Me and Jeff shared a wall and a backyard. Jeff was the brook master, he knew stuff like what a crayfish was. I didn't know anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            We both put on our rubber boots and went in. It felt like a place knights would clash with orks. I looked up stream, then turned and looked down stream. I thought about what was around each corner. To the left was the past, to the right the future. I never explored in either direction. Just the image of it bending into the unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
            Me and Jeff were a couple of guys at the brook passing time, spotting fish, just taking it in. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Jeff went to a different school. At my school we were getting ready for Field Day. Just a big day of recess. It extended into baseball diamonds and wood patches and everything else. Field Day was the endcap of a fine year of Kindergarten. I bobbed for apples, I rode a pony, I toured the cab of an eighteen wheeler. I played beanbag games. I had learned that I could sprint. I started racing other kids. I was fast. I beat everyone. I was a bit of an athlete, with my dad's genes. It was the start of my rise. My rise to becoming the king of the playground.

            In January, Star Wars: A New Hope was re-released in theaters, a remastered and slightly edited version of the original. The SPECIAL edition. The next month Empire Strikes Back was released, and then Return of the Jedi. This was the highlight. I was fifteen years late to see the originals in the theater but it had come back around. I got it on the retreat. It felt like cosmic energy reaching out, letting me know that I wasn't late but right on time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had already seen the original trilogy on VHS at home, but this was different. It was like putting batteries in all of our toys, inside our brain.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Gus and I were looking up at the screen. The final trailer concluded and it was quiet for a moment, then the lights went down. The theater was packed. People rushed out a final whisper. Their childhood was returning, ours was in full swing. It was like going back to 1977, to 1980. Then the music...

            When I was bored at school I thought of the weekend coming up with my dad. It felt like fresh air to see him. He was a reprieve from the routines, from our parenting parent. He made us laugh. Wherever we lived, he drove in to see us. He'd pull right into the driveway. He and my mom never spoke. If they did, it was a few monotone words, and then we were off.

            We ordered meatball subs at the pizza place around the corner. We called a meatball sandwich without a meatball a 'soggy': Italian bread, tomato sauce, mozarella cheese. Meatball subs often became soggies while you ate them, whether you liked it or not.
        <p>
            I held my meatball sub with both hands and took a big bite. A meatball and some guts fell out the bottom.

            New Jersey Italians really knew how to cook. Any old pizzeria, damn.

            My mom dropped me off at school an hour before it started, in the care of my 1st grade teacher Mrs. Connolly. My mom periodically had jobs, ones in her field of pharmaceuticals/chemistry, but she didn't keep them for too long. I wouldn't have either. But in these times she needed a hand taking care of us. Mrs. Connolly was everyone's mom or grandma, depending on how old you were, so she became my morning babysitter. She did it for free, took me down to the school kitchen and made me waffles at 7 AM. Two blueberry Eggos. She even cut them into bite sized chunks, then asked me questions about life at home, what I liked to do for fun. To top it all off, she actually listened to my answers. She gave me full eye contact and smiled. Who was this person? Why was she spending time with me like this? Who knows. I just used it. I ate my waffles.

            Hopewell was like a little town inside of a snow globe. The secret was that this was a far above average place to grow up. The surrounding towns didn't know this and, if they had, would have postured to move in. They would have invaded and ruined everything. Taken Mrs. Connolly for themselves.

            I was starting to hit my stride. I was no longer a totally useless snot. I had grown muscle. I was racing other kids and winning. My calves were taking shape. My ego was forming and I was beginning to find my place amongst my peers. I was the king of the playground. They were starting to buy me ice cream sandiwches so they could be my lieutenants.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was somehow a cool kid but so was everyone else. It wasn't a ladder but a circle. Everyone was different and brought something unique to the table. You were valued for what you brought, not what you didn't have. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Kirby was a bit of an extreme case. He knew what quarks were. AT 7. I didn't even know what air was. He was so special he had no friends, except me. He could only wear black. His hair was black, too. All that over pale white skin. He talked really fast and in a bit of a high pitched voice, like an angry bird. But he knew what quarks were and was smarter than the teachers. He was way ahead of everyone and so he was alone. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Kirby had so much to offer but most people didn't see it because he'd get so emotionally distressed and lose it in class. He'd just start flailing. He'd scream and cry in front of everyone and then run out of the room. The littlest thing would set him off and he'd start shaking like a fizzy can. All of his internal wiring seemed to be jacked into one battery in a corner of his brain, with wires missing from other parts. Most people had their wires spread out, so they seemed more normal if unexceptional.
        </p>
        <p>
            This part of the brain that Kirby had was the kind that wouldn't work for him in grade school but would catapult him to greatness later on, if he could make it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted to see through the conventionally unattractive bits of people and get to the marrow. I was many people's only friend and Kirby was one. Jeff was another. I was attracted to weirdos because even though I was the King of the Playground, I was also one. I had more Kirby than I knew. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Kirby and I connected for real. We both liked fighting games like Mortal Kombat and Killer Instinct. We would continue to play the game outside—create new characters and act out a little scene. We talked through all the special moves our character had, then did a little kick in the air, or whatever move we had. We placed our fist down against our palm when we were ready to fight.
        </p>
        <p>
            We were playing the game in Kirby's backyard when I accidentally pushed him a little too hard. He fell back into dirty swamp water. A big splash and now nothing as we both processed it. Then he crowed like a distressed bird. It was a haunting sound. I was terrified and didn't know what to do. It was an accident but Kirby was on his ass, in the water. I slowly backed away. I knew I was going to be in so much trouble. How couldn't I be, I pushed Kirby into the water. It was like killing him. Kirby looked mortified and just lay there. I kept walking backward. I didn't say anything, didn't say I was sorry or see if he needed help. He looked fine but I could have moved forward instead of back. Then I made the decision to run home and never see Kirby again. I couldn't face what I had done.
        </p>
        <p>
            I did see Kirby again but we were never friends again. I pushed him just a little too hard.

            October melted into November. The days were short and grey, like an old lady. I walked home with my friend John and we played over at his house. He and his family emigrated from Cuba and were renting a place on Broad Street, the prime strip. All their stuff in the other rooms was covered with sheets, it was so weird. What were they hiding under there? 
        </p>
        <p>
            John was a rich kid whose identity as a young professional was already being formed by his parents. His hair was parted to one side and loaded with gel. He had a nice watch that always rode up his arm because it was made for adults. He was constantly shaking his wrist to get the watch back down there. His clothes were nice and his shirt was always tucked in. At least he was allowed to play video games. Mario Kart 64 couldn't be ironed out of him so easily.
        </p>
        <p>   
            It didn't seem like John wanted to be all grown up but his parents certainly did, instead of just letting whatever happen. John rarely smiled unless you made him laugh. You could tell he wasn't loving it, but what could you do? So we just played Mario Kart until it was time for him to eat dinner and me to go home.
        </p>
        <p>
            A few years later my mom would take me to visit John, still in that same house on Broad Street. My mom always wanted me to stay in touch with old friends, no matter what. I tried to hang out with him a little but he wouldn't acknowledge me. He just played Game Boy. He looked just as unhappy as ever.

            I was walking home from school and it started to snow. I ran home the rest of the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inside, my mom was making a fresh tomato sauce. She slowly churned the guts of the sauce with a ladle, from the bottom of the pot to the surface. The smells flew up my nostrils like little jet planes and fired missiles into my brain. I had to get my homework done super fast so I could go play outside. Jeff would be around. If he wasn't I'd go down the list. I had a character I wanted to try out and the snow was the perfect backdrop.
        </p>
        <p>
            The little flakes whipped and flowed. My mom made dinner. Many miles away my dad drove to his home in the snow, listening to the radio. I put on my boots and went outside to play.

            Chestnuts were roasting on an open stereo downstairs. My mom poured 3 glasses of eggnog. Last Christmas we got matching tops and bottoms, my brother in green and me in red. So we wore them this year. We'd probably get new ones. We'd probably get socks. All I wanted was toys and games. I would settle for both.
        </p>
        <p>
            We got socks. But we also got Strike Gunner S.T.G. for Super Nintendo. My brother asked and Santa delivered. We bribed him with cookies and milk. I sweetened the deal with a candy cane.
        </p>
        <p>
            Strike Gunner was super hard. It was a top-down, vertically-scrolling jet fighter game that took you by storm. I was exceptionally bad at it and would lose all three of my lives within the first two missions. Then I'd watch my brother continue on for a couple missions before he, too, got taken out. The gimmick was that you chose a special weapon beyond your normal guns. One was a giant beam of energy that shot straight out of the front of your jet, another one was a series of missiles that went out in all different directions. Then there was one that gave you a protective shield for a few seconds. There were fifteen total options. The strategy of the game revolved around picking the right special weapon for the mission. We didn't know this right away but after enough blowouts my brother started to catch on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our favorite thing about Strike Gunner was the music. It was electronic. It got you pumped. It held nothing back and just came at you.
        </p> 
        <p>
            We couldn't dump too many hours into Strike Gunner because it was so hard and our will to improve just wasn't there. But we'd always come back to it just to die in the first few levels. It was a classic arcade game in its art and difficulty level, straight from Japan. We just weren't ready.

            It was just past 8 on my 8th birthday. I never go out this late but something was calling. I put on my boots and went into the font yard, let the door close quietly behind. There was nothing out here. Same old same old. Too cold, too dark. I looked up. The sky was clear. The stars seemed close enough to eat. I reached up. I thought if I could just reach far enough...

        <p>
            In second grade I had Mrs. King. We read a story about little six inch tall people who lived in human homes. It was called, wait for it, The Littles. It felt like advanced reading at 8 years old. Our desks were pushed into groups of four, to make a table where we faced each other. It was a thing of who was at your table. Sometimes the cute girl, sometimes your best friend. Sometimes the weird kid. We were assigned in-class reading of a chapter of The Littles every day and you'd just have to sit there and read it at the table. It was pretty awesome but I wasn't always able to retain what I read. I just let my eyes glide over the words and thought about something else.
        </p>
        <p>
            Storytime at the carpet was easier. Your mind could wander and then you could slide back in, or you could be in there the whole time. When Mrs. King read Jack and the Magic Treehouse, I was usually in there. I listened to the different stories then wandered off into plots of my own. The cool part of Jack and the Magic Treehouse was that when Jack and his sister went on an adventure, time would stop. They could enter just before dinner, spend hours or even days in prehistoric times observing the dinosaurs, then emerge from the Treehouse and be called in to eat.

            Reading was always a big part of Hopewell's education and it made me interested in books and in writing my own. They didn't mess around at Hopewell Elementary.

            Me and Jeff were around the corner from our house in the sea of bushes there. The bushes were a kid and a half tall and had enough space between them to zig-zag through. We ran from the street-side all the way back to the dead-end, where there were a pair of garage stalls. One had his family's car in it, the other had a bunch of our crap in it.
        </p>
        <p>
            We were fooling around back there, around the garage stalls, each with a stick. You always had to have a stick. We were playing our normal games when something happened. We got close. We were in one of the garage stalls. Somehow we both had the same idea. My heart was suddenly a little kick drum in my chest. My head moved close to his, our lips touched. We kissed. Afterwards we said nothing. It wasn't awkward. Moments later we were zig-zagging through the bushes again.

            It was a wet winter but it was starting to peter out. Not much snow this time around which pretty much sucked. But it wasn't the only thing that sucked. In March we got the bad news: the people renting our big white house one town over, the one my parents bought before we were even born, were moving out. That was our income stream to pay rent in Hopewell. Without it we were doomed. There was a little deliberation with our old guy landlord but there wasn't much he could do. He needed to collect his rent and we simply didn't have it.
        </p>
        <p>
            In April of '98 we found ourselves moving out of our Hopewell duplex. Oki-dokie. It should have been a very sad day but it was just another change. We had seen so many. It was a wonder our stay in Hopewell lasted this long. All I had known was floating from one spot to the next. Nothing lasted more than a few months until now. We had almost three good years in Hopewell and it was enough to clean the system and show us what a real childhood and home could look like. We didn't really belong in this town, we were just pretending but had managed all the same.

            While the movers carted our stuff out, I played Killer Instinct, a fighting game for Super Nintendo. I always got to the same point in the game and struggled. TJ Combo, the big black boxer, was kicking my ass. I typically chose Black Orchid, a badass lady, but had to switch it up. I went with a character I was working on, Spinal, an insane undead skeleton with a fucking sword.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the movers saw me playing. He dropped the box he was working on.
            <br />
            "Yo my son loves this game..."
            <br />
            He introduced himself as Darnell.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Wanna play?" I asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            He sat down next to me and we actually played 1v1. My mom wasn't happy because he was supposed to be working. He was supposed to be moving our shit out! What did his buddies think? And no shit, he chose TJ Combo, the big boxer. Luckily Darnell sucked ass at the game and I devoured his infant gamer soul with Spinal in just a few swipes. I just laid into him, mashing buttons, pressing him up against the edge of the screen, making him wish he was never born. He had a good attitude about it.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Awwww man you're good at this game!"
        </p>
        <p>
            Poor Darnell. I wasn't good, he was just a world class noob. Nice guy, though. We fist-bumped and he got back to work.

            Where did they take our stuff? We had so much. So much STUFF. Too much. How much did we really need? Change of clothes, Game Boy, Super Nintendo, some snacks...I didn't understand.
        </p>
        <p>
            We ended up in a motel with two beds for the three of us. I probably should have been horrified but just played with my little Micro Machines. I moved them across the pillow. I made little car engine noises for acceleration, deceleration, change lanes really fast, brake really fast, slow brake, swerve, idle, etc. When a car would stop I would rock it back and forth a little, as a car does.
        </p>
        <p>
            I lined the cars up in two long traffic lines, then slowly moved it, like they were in gridlock. I inched each little thumbnail sized car up starting with the front two. Somehow, this was the most fun a person could have. I kept playing, left alone to do my thing even in such a small place. We were all in the same room but somehow acted independently. I spent hours moving the cars around the bed. I wasn't in a motel room but a foggy mountain pass. The cars were coming from nowhere and going nowhere, with no purpose whatsoever but to keep inching forward.
        </p>
        <p>
            On Tuesdays the hotel had a buffet and we laid into it. My mom packed an extra box to the brim and took it home. You took what you could get. The universe was unfair and there were people all over with things they didn't deserve or without things they had earned. We took a small nibble. 
        </p>
        <div align="center";>&#42 &#42 &#42</div>
        <p>
            The motel wasn't bad at first but it was slowly killing us. I mean Jesus... My mom was exhausted. We needed a break. As we approached the middle of the year we ended up back where we started. Where we actually started: Montgomery, New Jersey, in the big white house. We went from a tiny hotel room for a couple of months to <i>that</i> thing. Wow. I didn't know how or why it happened but I was alright with it as long as I could keep on doing what I always had been. Give me a stick, a couple of action figures and a glass of water and I'd be good for 10 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            We moved in before our stuff got there in the truck. It was like camping out. The house was completely empty as we set our stuff down poked into each room. 
        </p>
        <p>
            "Hey guys-<span style="font-size: .9em">guys-</span><span style="font-size:.75em">guys-</span><span style="font-size: .6em">guys...</span>"

            It was epic. Not as epic as my shin splints, though. Evening hit and someone sawed my legs off, or tried. "Growing pains", where your bones are too big for your skin. I just sat there and moaned. I sat at the island in the kitchen, this massive kitchen goddamn. I couldn't relish in the beauty of this house because I was a growing boy. I was a crybaby.

            Fortunately my mom was making a family sized Stouffer's Meat Lasagna for us to feast on. It went into the oven a frozen red brick of salt, came out a delicious Itlaian meal. It didn't taste like normal lasagna, it had that something extra. Sugar, salt, cheese, chemicals, and a small clip of Santa's beard. We didn't know any better, we slid a giant cube of it onto our plate with a few scoops of frozen peas and forgot our troubles. I almost forgot about my shin splints.

            It was just another day of <b><a href="momscooking.html">mom's cooking<sup>2</sup></a></b>. She got some help from the box and can but most of her ideas were Italian traditions. When she did use prepared stuff, it was usually just a starting point. It wasn't always the healthiest but it was the '90s. She could have opted to not cook at all and just shoveled Burger King down our throats—fast food was cheap in '98—but she slaved away for hours instead. She'd set the table and march it all over and we'd just demolish it in five minutes, leaving her to clean up. Hers was a thankless post and one that took me decades to understand.

            It was a town of big homes on big plots of land. People didn't really use their yard, it was just a buffer between you and the next guy. It made getting anywhere such a pain in the ass. You'd walk like 10 minutes and only pass five homes. It was like being on a treadmill, in Hell. It was like being in a nightmare. I tested to see if I were in a nightmare and screamed. Nothing came out. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead of sidewalks there needed to be moving walkways, like in airports. Then we'd get around almost as fast as in Hopewell. Extend the moving walkways all the way to the grocery store. Build them into highways. Imagine going like 20 on one of those things. 25 with a high speed walk. And then to get off you'd jump off the side, into sand. This is the best idea.
        </p>
        <p>
            The worst part of Montgomery was its total lack of an actual town. Hopewell had one, you could even walk to it. But you couldn't even drive to one here. It was just homes and farmland, then more homes. Then...MORE FARMLAND. It makes my head spin. It meant that your street and the few surrounding blocks had to be good. You had to hope there were kids in those 20-50 homes for you to get along with, otherwise you were screwed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Right away I knew something was very wrong about Montgomery. Not just because of the spacing, but because of how kids were—how they treated each other.

            My first play date was with a kid named Kyle down the street. My mom wanted me to meet some kids in the neighborhood and he was lucky number one. The whole time I was over his house he played video games and didn't look at me. He barely talked to me. I just kind of hung out and watched him play. We went outside in the driveway and shot some hoops. He basically just played by himself. Then he got bored of pretending and called up his friend, Chris, to come over. He and Chris hung out instead. Pretty soon I just went home.

            It had become a tradition to shop for my Halloween costume WAY early. August came around and I was ready. I knew what I wanted to be and I wanted to start putting it together. It always included a mask. Without a mask you weren't doin shit. It had to be medieval, or sci-fi, or something horrible. You'd never find me going as something stupid like a sign, or like a ketchup bottle. Hey me and my brother are going as Ketchup and Mustard! Shut up. Also the shirt and pants with the skeleton bones on them SUCKED. Some kids could get away with it but not me, I'd be fired from my own life. I had to do more. It didn't have to look good or make any sense but it had to be A LOT. Layers, bits of whatever draping down, some kind of bulky mask I couldn't breathe through or see out of. If I wasn't horrifying or confusing people, if I wasn't walking into trees, then it wasn't a costume.
        </p>
        <p>
            My mom took us to the mall. We spent the extra time to drive to the better one, up in Bridgewater. The mall was a staple hangout and the place to be. Just walking the mall was an activity. Stores were overflowing wth people. People left their house and congregated in open spaces. Even if you didn't know anyone, you all had the same idea to go to the mall and were there at the same time. There was some semblance of community to it all, just like when you all sat down in the same packed movie theater.
        </p>
        <p>
            We entered through the Macy's. I couldn't get through fast enough. My brother and I raced but didn't run. People would always yell at us. We were awful. Hoodlums, even. We'd fight all the time, push each other into displays, hide in the clothes then jump out like a Xenomorph. We were fizzy cans shaken and then cracked open in your face. It was way worse in Church. In the mall we could at least blend in a little. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We speed-walked through the Macy's, passing one perfume stand after another, blasting right past the expensive watches, the suits, seas of women's clothing. My mom loved this store so she stopped to check out a thing and me and my brother had to circle back, or play hide-and-go-seek in the clearance foliage. Hide-and-get-banned-from-the-mall.
        </p>
        <p>
            But once my mom had her fill it was Time. Time to get me a Halloween costume. And I wasn't going to back down. If it were my dad taking us he'd probably say no to everything. He wasn't going to spoil us. But I could juice my mom for way more. Hey, it was for a good cause. It was brain food. I told myself I was going to grow up and be a creative person and this was my decade of experience. Little did I know.

            My brother would get his blueberry crumble pie slice. He would get a strawberry-banana smoothie. He would get Panda Express. My mom would get a blouse or a pair of pants, maybe some shoes. I would get my costume. It was only August but it was already Halloween season. I had to be this character for months. I had to perfect it. I needed to wear the costume around the house at least 50 times, walk up to people with everything on and have them guess what I was. And if they didn't, adoration and compliments would do.
        </p>
        <p>
            I turned the corner and saw it. It was one of the first stores outside the Macy's, in the main part of the mall where all the good stores were. It was huge. In some malls it was Spencer's Gifts, in others it was Party City. Sometimes Halloween Mart. They all put on a good gig. They had the masks up on the wall, in a grid formation, with most too high to grab. Skeletons and monsters and demons, strange stuff like a hooded mask with prison bars for a face (awesome). I scanned it all, took it in, let it fill me up. I wanted most of it. I wanted this wall of masks in my basement. Just be a different one each day. Wear it to school.
        </p>
        <p>
            We all scanned the grid. Even my mom got involved. She pointed certain things out she thought were cool or that I'd like. She was sometimes right but she didn't fully <i>understand</i>. Then I saw it. They weren't all together but scattered across the wall in different places. I saw the Darth Vader one first. Then the Storm Trooper one. Down a ways was a Boba Fett mask, too. Was it a mask or a helmet? I always called them masks. So did Darth in the movie. He definitely wasn't wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Vader one was $60. Hard plastic, 2 piece. I had to have it. And I was comin back for the Storm Trooper one next year. Don't say no to me, I'll scream. This was going to be the year I went as Darth Vader. I was going to look exactly like the movie. 6 foot 6, full armor, destroying people. All I needed was the helmet. I locked onto it. I raised my arm and pointed. It was $60 and 1/3rd the size of my whole body. I looked up at it like it was the Virgin Mary. The guy took it down for me. My mom scrounged together the bills, the cents, the everything. Just as long as I could have the costume I wanted. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My brother got a Scream mask and a proper matching robe. It was cool enough. He'd look better to everyone else but I'd look better to myself. We left the store, on our way to the food court now. The place was a scene. People moving back and forth, up and down. The escalators were jammed. Every store had people holding things up, trying things on, checking things out. Beep, beep. Cha-ching. The food court wafted in. My brother was eager. He'd get his Chinese takeout, I'd get a stromboli. My mom took care of everything. Kept fishing into her purse. Life was good. I dunked my stromboli into the sauce. What a day.

            I was entered into third grade with Mr. Gebhart, whose eyes were telescoped to a huge degree by the thickness of his glasses. He was stocky, with a shaved head and red goatee. He was intense but super awesome. He felt like a continuation of the kind of teachers I had at Hopewell: strong, intelligent, passionate about education. He could tell I was interested in class and creative in my own right, so we got along.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was around this time that the Crazy Bones fad was in full throttle. Crazy Bones were little plastic figures, smaller than golf balls, that came in packs of five. We bought them at Zainy Brainy, I don't know where other people bought them. There was an aspect of gambling to it all. You didn't know what you were going to get in the pack because it was opaque, but you could feel around for certain shapes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like all of this kind of stuff, there were certain ones that were rare and others that were much more common. The rarest one was Speedy, a globular character with goggles and a helmet. A racer type. Second to him was Menace, another globular one with messy hair and a shit eating grin. Because the two rarest ones were spherical in shape, I felt the pack before buying it to see if there was one in there. The packs were expensive so if you weren't doing this you were full chumpin. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You brought your collection to school and traded with other kids. I traded one golden Menace for nine different Bones. I didn't know then and I don't know now whether it was a good trade or not.
        </p>
        <p>
            One time I was going for a specific Bone and this girl Ailynn had it. It was a golden Champ. Champ was like a chalice with a shit eating grin. I wanted him. I had a Champ already but it was green, not good. I wanted Ailynn's. I had a few she was missing. She thought she was getting the better end of the deal and I thought I was too. We met over by the coats, shoved ourselves in there and traded. I reached out my hand, she reached out hers. In my hand plopped the golden Champ, in hers 3 different ones. She smiled, I smiled. We looked down at our new stuff, then said see ya around. Mr. Gebhart had one eye on us. The coats got a story.

            The difference between Hopewell and Montgomery was stark. I didn't make friends the way I did in Hopewell. I was the king of the playground there but in Montgomery I was the outsider, the weirdo. I went from popular kid to bottom of the food chain. It was cliquey. I was poor and they were rich. It seemed like everyone was part of a club and you had to pay to get in. I wasn't the type to pay. I wasn't much of a follower. I wasn't getting in.
        </p>
        <p>
            The desks were arranged in groups of four to form tables, just like in Mrs. King's class. At snack time I pulled out my crushed peanut butter and jelly sandwich and apple slices, which had already turned brown. Across the table Melissa pulled out her perfect sandwich on white bread and a bag of Combos. Combos were pizza-pretzel snacks in the shape of small barrels. They came in seven or eight to a pack and were delicious. They were heavy and full of flavor and STUFF. And man I never had them at home. My lunches were usually pretty lame and Melissa's were high end.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every day I asked Melissa for a Combo. Just one. Every day she rejected me. She never gave me one. I politely asked and she just shook her head, looked away. This was the general vibe of Montgomery. Montgomery in a nutshell. No Combos given.

            Loud noises were pounding into my brain. What the hell. It was my alarm. My alarm was the worst, why did I have it. It was so loud it warbled. It was 7:15 AM. I smashed the top of the clock, rubbed the crust out of my eyes. So much crust, almost crouton sized. At least I had gotten 9 hours of perfect sleep. I must have been in the same position all night. It felt like I had closed my eyes one second and opened them the next. But there were nine hours between the two. Vampire sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had a little bed head that I patted down. It sprouted back up. I patted it down. It wouldn't go. I used water. It didn't help. I looked in the mirror at it, tried to will it down. It didn't work. I got dressed in chinos and a polo shirt, made sure everything was in my backpack for school. Made sure I had some Crazy Bones in the back pocket. I was still OK with going to school. School was fine. This was before puberty so kids were still kids. But we were fast approaching the darkness: acne, boners, betrayals, confusing depression, more boners.
        </p>
        <p>
            My mom was making breakfast. She usually woke up really early. She'd fall asleep on the couch watching TV at 8 or 9, then wake up in the middle of night and do...stuff. She was always hammering away at something. Domestic legal stuff, sometimes a little consulting work. I wish I saw her working on a project of her own once in a while, or just reading a book. Her life didn't seem all that fun.
        </p>
        <p>
            The scrambled eggs were steaming. She painstakingly picked out the little placentas of the egg before cooking, which only made me think they were in there in the first place and it grossed me out. Eggs are really gross if you think about it. My mom added milk to give them a bit more volume, then poured the big yellow liquid into the pan. They never tasted as good with milk but I guess it saved money. I would have been happy with less egg if it tasted better, but I didn't say anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a separate pan she fried up three frozen sausage links, then took her position in front of the blender, went to town on a whole mountain of ingredients in there. In only a few minutes everything was done in synchrony. She assembled it all on a plate, dropped in a slice of toast with fake butter, made a second trip for the smoothie and in her other hand a multivitamin. It was a feast, ready just in time for me to take my seat at the table. There was just one more thing to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            She rotated over and turned the nine inch kitchen TV on. It sat on the counter adjacent to the table. A little square TV pointed at me. It was my morning pit stop before the bus. My mom navigated to the correct channel from yesterday night's whatever, landed on the last few minutes of Pokemon. I always arrived in time to see Team Rocket blast off again. Pokemon wasn't my favorite. It had its moments but it just seemed odd. I never understood why they cried literal hoses of water from their eyes. It was too much. But I wasn't there for it. At 7:30 Beast Wars would come on. That was the highlight. All the characters had so much personality. Cheetor, he was awesome. Rattrap, too. I was fully engaged in the story every day. It was another one of these "bad guys always lose" ones, but it was still awesome.
        </p>
        <p>
            At 7:58 Beast Wars was over and I had to catch the bus. So long, beautiful morning, you tasted good. I'll miss you until tomorrow. I grabbed my things and flew out the front door. School wasn't so bad. I wasn't pretending to be sick yet. Thanks, mom. Thanks, Beast Wars.

            We finally got Nintendo 64 for Christmas and were playing the hell out of it. We barely left the house. My brother really wanted to play the Zelda sequel, Ocarina of Time, so we got that. I watched him play a bunch. He would also just go at it entirely alone for days on end and well into the night. Night would come and he'd forget to turn the light on in so it'd be him alone in the dark in front of a bright TV. He was in a room called "the sock room". We called it that because before we cleaned it up and moved the game systems in there it was absolutely obliterated by unmatched socks. An entire room of socks, what the hell.
        </p>  
        <p>  
            I watched my brother play everything from Zelda to Oddworld to Metal Gear Solid. It was like watching a movie directed by your older brother.

            We were out with our dad at Best Buy. This was what you did. In the 90s you actually went places. Going to the store was the activity. Malls but also just any store that had stuff. We walked around, browsed, sometimes bought something. Sometimes we went to the Wiz, sometimes Borders. Every once in a while it was Toys R Us where I'd end up on the floor screaming and pounding my head off if my dad said I couldn't have the thing I wanted. My life would be complete if I just got that Boba Fett action figure. I would play the shit out of it for a week then it'd fall into the pile. Then I'd scream and cry again. My dad wouldn't give in. He walked away from me as I made a total scene, screaming like I was being stabbed in the face. People were horrified but my dad wasn't going to negotiate with a terrorist. 
        </p>
        <p>
            But Best Buy was one of our favorites. Inside was everyone's Christmas list, especially the stuff they weren't going to get. The automatic doors opened and I was immediately gripped by the air conditioning. The smell of commercial cardboard boxes, vacuumed carpet, a hint of window cleaner, some lady's double-shift B.O. Immediately to the right were all the computers. Every single time we'd radar in, run over to the section and screw around. See which ones were on, try to open the programs, change something. My brother and I craved control over SOMEthing. At least my brother did, but it rubbed off. Just get in there. Move a cone from one isle to another. Try to install a game on a Best Buy computer. Try to play some music. We could have been way nastier. We didn't even know what porno was yet. 
        </p> 
        <p>
           On this particular day we didn't spend too much time goofing around. My brother had his eye on something. He had been circling a game he discovered through an online community that were all playing this immersive role playing game, EverQuest. It had a monthly subscription attached but my brother convinced my dad to foot it. It was a beautiful game and just what my brother was looking for: an escape from middle school where he got bullied and physically attacked for being different. In EverQuest and on the forums, people were more forgiving. If you played EverQuest you could find your family. I mean you could still get into it and people were still tools sometimes but you could deal with it, and you were safe at the computer. You could make friends easily by showing up, leveling up your character, and joining a guild. Everyone was a misfit and it brought people together. It was a great alternative to the detritus that was middle school.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anything was better than the Montgomery school system. I thought about Hopewell, being back there, being the King of the Playground. But all of that was just a dream.

            In April I went to see The Matrix with my brother. It was the new Star Wars. The <i>real</i> new Star Wars just a month before the fake actual Star Wars: Episode 1 was released. The Matrix had the magic. I left the theater launching kicks in the air. I needed a pair of sunglasses immediately. I was floating on ideas for the sequel. I had so much new raw material in my brain that needed to be fixed into something. The creators of The Matrix had done it, they had made something truly special.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's medicine for society to have a movie like The Matrix. Things just get duller and duller and eventually people forget that magic actually exists. We all just need something to blow our brain and shake up the sediment every once in a while. Remind us that people are still trying, really bringing it and not compromising, despite the chance of epic failure. The shake-up had finally arrived and we were grateful. We drank it in.

            For Christmas I had gotten a radio-CD-player combo. But I needed something to put inside it. I ended up buying Backstreet's Back and played it every night before I went to sleep. I went to bed at 9 oclock listening to it, matching it with little videos in my head. I only ever got through three tracks before getting too tired. I'd always skip track 3, "All I Have to Give" because it was boring, and end on track 4, "That's The Way I Like It".
            I slid the button on the radio to the left to shut it off, rolled onto my side and sank into deep sleep for nine full hours.
        </p> 
        <p>
            I awoke to strips of sun coming through the blinds, a room full of toys on the floor from yesterday's unfinished storylines. I grabbed my folded chinos and polo shirt and headed to the bathroom. It was another day of third grade. The year was almost over and an unpredictable summer of adventure awaited. I just had to make it there and I'd be fine.

            May and June evaporated and I was suddenly enrolled in tennis camp with my brother. At tennis camp there was a special counselor, Chris. Chris was the highlight. He looked like a beach model with long blond hair, high cheekbones and a chizzled jaw. He coached the more advanced students and even though I wasn't great at tennis yet, I always fought to be in his group. I would have been miserable in a different group with some generic counselor, softly feeding balls over the net. I'd be waiting for the day to be over. Chris made all the difference.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chris could have been a pro tennis player but other things got in the way. He said he was just lazy, but man he could really play. I had the dumb thought of who would win between him and my dad, but he'd totally whip my dad. His serve was so fast almost no one could return it. It had so much spin that it'd hit the ground and bounce five feet in the other direction, or five feet over your head. He hit the ball so hard that it trembled in mid air. Sometimes he'd serve into us, for fun. We'd barely see the ball as it blew by us at 150 miles per hour. Or it'd take your raquet for a ride 20 feet in some direction.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Chris would peg balls at you if you ran too slow, but he'd also compliment you on a good shot. We all wanted to be his friend, and it seemed possible. He treated us like little bros. The one strike against him was that he spoiled The Sixth Sense for all of us. It had just come out and he blurted the big twist. We threw brownies at him. We didn't let him live it down. He pegged balls at us.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the start of each week a race was held between all the counselors. They sprinted across the five outdoor clay courts and back. Chris won every time. On Wednesdays there was an eating competition where you had to stuff as much pizza or cereal or whatever down your face as possible. Chris won every week. Chris was the best at everything. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Chris drove us home one day and we saw a pack of cigarettes on the floor of his car. He noticed that we noticed. "How'd those get in here?" he laughed through his nose. It was a cool guy's laugh, he did it all the time. Single thrust through the nose and a little sound: UNH. UNH. I wanted to laugh like that. It was cooler than how I'm describing it.
        </p>
        <p>
            He kicked the cigarettes back under the rubble of crap in his Jeep and pulled out of the parking lot, top down and pedal to the metal the whole way home. The wind was powerful, I could barely see. Chris' hair just whipped and flowed.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Chris was a man's man and a lady's man. He could have been a tennis pro but was a camp counselor instead.

            In our tennis group there was a kid named Ward who we befriended. We were camp friends, not best buds. He was closer to my brother's age and was no good at tennis. He was overweight and didn't have a good stroke. He just kind of punched the ball back and hoped you'd make a mistake. Poor Ward, he sweat like a maniac too. He wasn't very athletic but he was trying, you had to give him that.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was lunchtime and the chlorine was wafting in. We munched on our sandwiches, looked out at the clay court we practiced on being belted by the sun. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The three of us got to talking. It came out that Ward played Starcraft, too. 
        </p>
        <p>
            "What race do you play?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Protoss," he said. My brother and I both played Zerg.
        </p>
        <p>
            My brother said we should 2v2. We finished out the day of Tennis. Chris pegged balls at us. Pegged balls at Ward. Then we went home and played over dialup. Ward was about as good at Starcraft a he was at Tennis. My brother was carrying big Ward on his back. My brother was good.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ward kept sending his zealots in one by one.
        </p>
        <p>
            "What is he doing?" I asked. My brother didn't know either.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Don't worry," Ward typed. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Two minutes later he was dead.
        </p>
        <p>
            We were happy to have found someone else who played Starcraft, at least. We didn't think anyone in New Jersey played.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ward: Don't worry

            I banged my head on a branch.

        <p>
            That night I had two sets of nightmares. I was infected by an alien virus where my blood was acid and my dad wouldn't believe me. I had this horrible feeling. I shot fireballs into his face. He tried to beat me up. I ran away. I knew they were coming. Then the bad guys came. Killed my dad. I watched from the backyard.
        </p>
        <p>
            I woke up and had a glass of water, felt awful and relieved, pulled the blanket back over myself and cocooned. I was in it again. I was just waiting by the door, waiting for the bad people to come and kill me. I stood no chance. I knew if I ran they'd suddenly appear, pin me down and eat me through my back.
        </p>
        <p>
            AAAAAAGGgggggh fuck.
        </p>

            I woke up. Felt like a different person. Drained the glass of water.

            Before you could say SUMMER WOOHOOO it was already over. Barely got two months of peace before you were jammed back into the classrooms again. At least the first week was always exciting, getting school supplies and clothes and stuff. Then laying out your clothes for the first day. I would overthink it and change my polo shirt three or four times. NOBODY CARES, ERIC.
        </p>
        <p>
            Teachers always asked you to get three-ring binders but those things were actually just awful. It was always comp books for me, marble ones. Sometimes spiral. One or two under my arm with a couple of cheap-shit pens. I traveled light. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I got Ms. Puppo for 4th. She was new. She was cute and young and eager...the kind of teacher the Montgomery school system liked. Young cute female teachers everywhere. I guess they nailed the interview. They definitely smiled a lot. Puppo had red hair and freckles to go with it. She looked exactly like her name. Puppo. Her flourescently-lit room and sterile whiteboards was home for almost as long as my actual good home was. And damn the room was small as hell, like half the size of a regular classroom. It was like we were shoved in a meeting room or something. Surely this was temporary. No, it was just our room. I wonder what Puppo was thinking about. Did she hate the room, too? Was she just happy to have a job? Did she hate us? Did she have a boyfriend? 
        </p>
        <p>
            4th grade mostly sucked and was super forgettable, so while Ms. Puppo was talking I was often scribbling. I was writing. She thought I was taking notes. I never was. I was never a good student and didn't want to be. I just wanted to do my thing. I would turn 26 and still be a shit student. It never left me. March to my grave clutching my bullshit, into the sinkhole with my notepads and BIC pens.
        </p>
        <p>
            We were all jammed in there, taking spelling bees, doing 4th grade stuff. Nearly every ounce of it has left my brain other than the stories we wrote in class. My friend Ian, who would soon move on from me completely, wrote a story inspired by The Faculty, a body-snatchers movie about members of a high school being infested by aliens and acting nefariously. He used this framework and applied it to the kids in our class. I was good friends with him at first so I was the main bad guy. I was pulling all the strings and had a lot of scenes. Then he killed me off and promoted this kid Sean to Big Bad.
        </p> 
        <p> 
            Sean and I were friends too. He was the new kid but a bad kid. We were all friends for a year, then it was over. I wasn't cool enough in Montgomery to keep these people. The word got out that I was a loser or something and then they all turned on me, made fun of me, picked fights. But for a time it was great. I was kind of popular for a bit. I sat with Sean and watched him flirt with the cute girls. I didn't flirt but I was next to someone who did.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ian's story was creative and even though I got killed off with a laser blast to my chest, I was in there for a bit. I didn't mind getting killed off, I got to move on to different roles.

        <p>
            One role I moved onto was being Joe's friend. Joe was also new to the school but he wasn't a bad kid, thankfully. He was one of the good ones. Joe and I became friends and would become best friends. It would last several years before he, too, would move on. But his moving on was the smart kind. Joe didn't want to be a loser with me, going into high school. I was dragging him down, socially. I just couldn't make it work in Montgomery, man. The place stunk, it was no good. I couldn't cope. Joe wanted to cope and that didn't make him a bad guy. It was survival, which I had no interest in. Sink or swim, I went right to the bottom.

            In high school I would ride out my acne and depression and anxiety in solitude until it was all over. When it ended it felt like someone removing their fat ass from my chest. Good riddance to the whole thing. I wanted the whole town to sink into Hell.

            The bus dropped me off at 3:45. I couldn't get in the door fast enough. My brother was already out there.
        </p>
        <p>
            I grabbed my stick and ran out the door as fast as I came in, leaving smoke trails. The cul-de-sac was right around the corner. It wasn't a dead-end, it had a thru, but it's where we played hockey. There weren't too many cars to worry about, anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            I arrvied at the sac and the big kids were skating like pros. Jordan, Walter, Ben, even my brother was good on skates. Ben was Chinese, Walter was the whitest kid ever. Jordan had a bit of a tan, at least. But Ben was the best at hockey and he was the best at everything. He was just a 10 all around. He scored, he played defense, he passed the puck (tennis ball) and then berated and laughed at you if you screwed it up. He was physical and intense, and funny as hell. He was the alpha. We all knew it.
        </p>  
        <p>  
            You had to have a sense of humor and some thick skin. It was well worth being included. What are you gonna do, not play?
        </p>
        <p>
            I arrived in my sneaks and got a mouthful from the guys. 
        </p>
        <p>
            "Eri when you gonna get skates, bud?" said Jordan.
        </p>
        <p>
            He was right. You weren't really playing if you just had sneaks. You had to run after everything, which was so much slower. It was also dangerous. You were an obstruction that could get balled over easily, or force the other guys to swerve and sometimes go down. We didn't wear knee pads or elbow pads or helmets or any of that crap. It was a pair of blades and a stick. So if you went down avoiding someone in sneaks, it was a boo-boo for sure. And there were no mommies there to sow you back together.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were a couple of us who didn't have skates and we were always pressured to go get some. All the good players had them. It was time for me to get a pair.

            My dad picked us up for visitation weekend. We went to Olive Garden to start off, a cornerstone. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It was still the era of going places. You went places and walked around as an activity. People left their homes, went to the mall, went to The Wiz, went to Toys R Us, Circuit City. You didn't just sit at home with your finger up your butt.
        </p>
        <p>
            At Olive Garden I ordered the Chicken Scampi without peppers and onions. So bad without. But I was 10 so what can you do. The trick was stuffing your face with the all you can eat soup or salad and then taking your meal home. That was value. Most people didn't do this, but most people suck turds.
        </p>
        <p>
            What always surprised me about Olive Garden was their bread sticks. They were absolutely terrible. Everything else was so tasty, albeit cancerous, but the breadsticks were legitimate dung. They were big rods of shit. They tasted like giant soup crackers. How hard would it have been to make some decent bread? They could make Veal Marsala and Tour of Italy but they couldn't make bread?
        </p>
        <p>
            We left Olive Garden with 50 pounds of pasta, butter and salt in our stomachs and waddled to my dad's car. Just across the highway was The Sports Authority. I just couldn't believe I was going to have actual skates at hockey tomorrow. The guys were gonna light up. 
        </p>
        <div align="center";>&#42 &#42 &#42</div>
        <p>
            The Sports Authority was huge. The bright white lights made you feel like you were in a sports stadium, or being waterboarded. I felt small walking in. Everything was super marked up and you knew it, even back then. But it's where you got skates. They were all in a grid on the wall. We just salivated at the expensive ones, the Missions as they were called. They were like $300, so screw that. That was never going to happen. I settled for something around $80. I looked at them and their perfect, fresh wheels. They all had that dorky rear break which I was going to remove.
        </p>
        <p>
            At hockey, you didn't really want those skate breaks. Not only did they add 60 years to your age but you just didn't use them. To slow down or stop you'd curve in, lower your body a little. That was the most common way. People who couldn't do that would go 50 miles an hour over the curb and hope for the best. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The game was for real now. We had skates and nets and really good players. Every week I would improve and got damn good on the skates. As the afternoon crawled into twilight I was rabid. I was playing for hours and was actually keeping up with Jordy, Walt and Ben. Well shit, not Ben. But I was in there. I was getting aggressive and fighting for the puck. I was making good turns. You couldn't tell I was 10 and they 14, 15. I was really bombin' in. It was seamless. I was one of the guys.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next time we played I would suck shit and would have to relearn all the badass things I was doing yesterday, but it was clicking slowly. I was always mid tier but it was better than being crud. We had some stinkers at the sac and I was glad to rise from that steaming pile. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Ben, Walter and Jordy would always be better. My brother, too. That's alright. At least I got to play. 
        </p>

            I was 10 years old and kicking the shit out of Summer. The sun soaked in and powered me up. So much to do and so little time. Every year it was like a burning match. When the flame got to the end it was time for school again. Summer was like the great inside of really shitty blowpop. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I had so many friends I could take my pick: neighborhood friends or get driven to a friend, or have a friend come over. Friends poured in like popcorn. Like that book where the popcorn poured in. Where every room was filled with popcorn. Who was it going to be this time? Joe? Charlie? Jordan M? Connor? I was a juggle master. I was the king of the playground. King of Summer. We all brought the goods but I definitely brought it. Today it was a water balloon fight.
        </p>
        <p>
            Me and Charlie's backyards almost touched. He was diagonal. To go the back way I had to briefly pass through this guy's yard everyone was afraid of. No one ever saw him and it was rumored he'd shoot you if you were on his property. It wasn't true. He was just a dad. Probably a workaholic. To go the front way it was just around the block, through the cul-de-sac where we played hockey. Charlie was Walter's younger brother. He was my age but a grade lower. He was a little slow. He was a bit like Jeff from Hopewell. I always made friends with the slow kids. I was probably slow, too. I always thought I was a speedy smart alec. I was just another turnip. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Walter helped us fill up the water balloons in the sink. We used super soakers, too. The water balloons were your grenades and your super soaker was your main weapon. There were also little squirt guns you could use as a pistol. We were fully decked out. I stood at the sink filling up water balloons, tying them off like Walter taught me. I looked at myself in the mirror, thought I was so cool.
        </p>
        <p>
            I filled a backpack up to the zipper. Then filled up 2 buckets. It felt like I was in there forever. Were they playing without me? I had so many water balloons. They go fast, though. There was an unspoken rule to not just machine gun them out. Make them last. Line up a good shot and whip it off. Sometimes it'd hit someone and not even break. Sometimes it'd sound like you cracked a stick against a tree. The balloon exploded and sent wavelengths for blocks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Walter filled up a super soaker with soda, sometimes gatorade. Then when he drenched you the bees would swarm in. Geurilla tactics. I fired a water balloon at his head. He just dodged it. He was agile. Agile in hockey, too. A squirrely, slippery albino. He yelled at me to aim lower. I aimed lower. Fired one into his nuts. He struck back, threw twice as hard. It cracked against me like a major league home run. I fell to the ground like a bag of shit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Charlie and I would role play this story we made up. It was a sci-fi one about a squad of people who went on adventures and defeated bad guys. I was the monotone robot, Charlie was the leader. Our neighbors Sara and Emily joined, too. Even Charlie's little sister Alicia. We marched around the neighborhood coming up with little events, puzzles to solve. The sun beat down on us. We circled back to cool off by the hoze. The houses and yards were big but luckily we all lived close by. There was enough to chew on, especially in the Summer.
        </p>

            I continued on into 5th grade, but of course this was Montgomery so friendships were thin. You'd be palling with someone one minute then enemies with them the next. You'd think you were close and then they'd backstab you and gossip until their tongues were sore. Their tongues would get so sore from the gossip they'd fall limp out of their mouths and just hang there. At least half the kids walked through the halls with their dead tongues out.
        </p>
        <p>
            The whole Montgomery vibe was pushing me further into writing, which was a good thing. Writing was perhaps something I wouldn't be totally mediocre at. Even if I were, it didn't matter. You don't care if your medicine's mediocre if it gets rid of the pain. Doesn't have to be the BEST, COOLEST medicine.
        </p>
        <p>
            I spent most of the year writing upside down, out of boredom. I got good at it. It confused everyone. I kept doing it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wrote my own Star Wars Stories. So did my friend Tim. We were expanding the universe in our 99&#162; notebooks. We'd write a few chapters then swap. He'd read my stuff, I'd read his. I have to hand it to Tim and say his structure and pacing were better. But I had more passion. Damn, he'd write 6 or 7 pages in the time I wrote 30. I was a human type writer. I couldn't stop. I didn't think about what I wrote, I didn't try to plan it out. It was words flowing through my arm. There was a bomb in my head that would go off if I stopped.
        </p>
        <p>
            What else was I going to do, I was in Montgomery. I was an outcast but I'd always choose exile over death.

        <p>
            School can have its moments. Even in a town as desolate and soul-vacant as this one there were diamonds in the rough. In a dark room the smallest bit of light shines pretty damn bright.
        </p>
        <p>
            One such light was my 6th grade Language Arts teacher, Mr. Beardsley. I stuffed everything else from 6th grade into the trash, but not Beardsley. That guy was a pro. The best part about him was that he could write. He was 100% a writer. He shared some of his stuff with us in class, including one piece he called 'Coffee With Arthur'. It was extremely good. We gathered around the carpet and all shut up and listened. Even the hot chicks and cool guys just stared at him as he read from his book.
        </p>
        <p>
            He had a thing for life books and had everyone start one, then tracked our progress throughout the year. He went around the room checking in with us, stopped at each person's desk. He knelt down and spoke in a soft voice. He knew that writing was hard and most people didn't want to do it, that they would rather eat socks. But Mr. Beardsley actually believed in all of this stuff and wanted us to give a crap, too.
        </p> 
        <p>
            I was the life book king and filled the most books. Not only did I write the most but I was honest. It wasn't Dickens but I just laid it all out there. Most kids struggled to write anything. When they did write it was about their dog Bruno, or some other nonsense. It was just me and my friend Kevin who were trying to write. Kevin was a genius and a better writer, techincally, but I had more passion. We had been in the same class a couple years going and were in a couple of plays together. Kevin went on to teach at NYU. I didn't.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout 6th grade I was encouraged to write and it was appreciated. You couldn't buy a better ramp for yourself. Someone other than Beardsley would have messed it up—they'd have totally squashed your interest in writing. And in fact, for three years in high school they tried their best to do just that.
        </p>
        <p>
            High school English was like the breadsticks at Olive Garden while Middle School English was the meal. I got the good meal before the crappy breadsticks. Now that's insane.

            I was hanging out with Joe on the dirt mound. Across the street from his house they were erecting some bullshit, more homes. We were always cutting down trees and building homes.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a long time there was a massive dirt mound at the center of everything. It was at least 40 feet high. We played our games, acted out our stories, climbed to the top and looked out over the town. Just to have a dirt mound. We were easy to please. You just needed a little bit of something, then your imagination could take over.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time the mound got smaller and frameworks of homes started to move in. Eventually there was no mound at all and playtime was over.
        </p>
        <p>
            We played outside until we had nothing left and then walked home.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Joe had fewer material things than I did. He appreciated all of his stuff way more. His family owned big things that everyone could use, like a pool table and piano. The loose stuff, the smaller things, were limited. There was a subtlety and restraint to how he and his family lived. It was the very definition of quality over quantity. 
        </p>
        <div align="center";>&#42 &#42 &#42</div>
        <p>
            I was in art class with Mrs. Sprout. Mrs. Sprout looked like a gargoyle. Many wrinkles, a lot of makeup, and very thin. Her skin just kind of hung off in parts. Her eyes were engulfed in a blue makeup, her lips a bright red. Her jewelery clanked around her wrist, hung long off her neck.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mrs. Sprout was very theatrical about everything. She had to have lived alone, in terms of humans, and at least eight cats. She sounded like she smoked but I don't think she did. I looked down at my art, which was shit. We were all getting some lesson on Jackson Pollock's splatter paintings. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This one kid, Josh, a real asshole, and clown, wasn't doing a lick of work. He was leaning back in his chair, on its hind legs, like you weren't supposed to. He did it all the time and never did work. He was almost two years older than everyone else in the class. The back of his head was flat, like his brain was forgotten. He was a complete idiot and disruptive, too. Now he was going off on Pollock.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I could do that, I could do that," he kept saying. "I don't get it, an eight year old could do it."
        </p>
        <p>
            But you didn't Josh. You didn't. And you couldn't. I thought about Josh just melting into lava. So we wouldn't have to deal with him ever again, in any of our classes. Somehow I was stuck with him all the time. Him and his friends were some of the worst. I imagined them all living together in a truck trailer and eating sticks. Shitting themselves and eating that, too.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mrs. Sprout was nice, though. She gave some de-escalating response. Everyone knew Josh by now and it wasn't worth fighting him. It's all he wanted. He just wanted to watch the world burn. But dammit he was too stupid to be interesting. His world burning would be incredibly lame.
        </p>
        <p>
            The classroom phone rang. Mrs. Sprout instructed us to keep working and walked over to where the phone sat, right by the front door. She picked it up. I was looking at her. I looked at her as she went from happy Mrs. Sprout to Mrs. Sprout that just got punched in the face. Her lips moved and said:
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh my god..."
        </p>
        <p>
            She nodded. She had just gotten the news of her life and it wasn't good. She put the phone back on the receiver, put her hand to her mouth, and slowly re-entered the class. I had watched her the whole time. Now what?
        </p>
        <p>
            She gave us the news as best she could. An airplane had struck the Twin Towers. New York City was under attack.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was like Pearl Harbor or something. Every single person was talking about it. The footage was on every TV. Not just one plane, but two. Both towers were hit and after an hour of being engulfed in flames, went down. I couldn't really understand it, but it was obviously really bad. How could this happen? What was REALLY happening?
        </p>
        <p>
            I got home and the footage was being replayed on our small white kitchen TV. Over and over. My mom was on the phone. I kept watching it as a small black dot zoomed into the frame, flew straight into the second tower. And then a huge explosion. This wasn't like the movies at all, there was something visceral about it. You knew all those people instantly died, in the plane and in the building. The flames were real, everything was. It was hard not to keep watching. It was the moment of our lives and nothing would be the same ever again. Something was switched on, or off, probably off. The earth had been lobotomized in a way. We didn't feel it yet but something was definitely lost forever. A kind of innocence we all were taking for granted, that we were living with for decades.
        </p>
        <p>
            For months the 9/11 attacks were all that anyone talked about and all that was on TV. Again and again the footage was played. Not one plane, but two. One could have been a mistake, but then the second one came in. It was horrible. Footage of people jumping out of the building to avoid burning to death. What they must have thought on the way down...
        </p>
        <p>
            There were stories circulating of people who worked in the buildings, who got a flat tire or were sick that day. We weren't very far from the city, just an hour drive in. This felt real. It was real. Something truly God awful happened on September 11th, 2001 and we were all still processing it. Would continue to process it for years. No one could really believe it. We had been living under a rock, inside a bubble, wrapped in warm blankies. The real world had been shielded from us. 
        </p>

            Everybody was still wearing 9/11 but we had to shake it off at some point. The holidays were a pretty good opportunity to get distracted.
        </p>
        <p>
            At Christmas my mom went all out. Our house was like The North Pole. We set up a snow village so big it had its own zip code. Fake snow flowed down the stairs and wrapped around the banister. You found it in your hair. The tree was huge and decorated with a thousand ornaments and enough lights to take down the power grid. My mom and I spent most of the time doing the decorating and setting up, my brother was less interested.
        </p>
        <p>
            We even had a choo-choo train doing laps. It ran through the village as if the people could get off and on. The place was on fire. The carols were going and the eggnog was flowing. My mom seemed permanently tied up in the kitchen. Her classic chocolate-vanilla swirl cake was a hit, as well as her oatmeal-chocolate-chip cookies—grab'em while they're hot. They fell apart in our hand, we lapped up the crumbs. We were animals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Christmas morning was a site to behold. I don't know how she did it. Under the tree were the two longest strips of presents I had ever seen. Nobody had Christmas like this. The presents extended from the tree all the way out into the other room. Me and my brother both had over 25 boxes of gifts EACH. I had never seen anything like it. We didn't deserve it but there it was. How did she wrap everything? Why did she get so much? Most kids would have been electrified with five or six gifts each, but 25...
        </p>
        <p>
            My brother's boxes were red and mine were green. His were on the left and mine were on the right. We took our seats and posed for some photos. The photos kept coming, we kept posing. COULD WE JUST OPEN OUR GIFTS?
        </p>
        <p>
            We got the green light. My mom was done snapping. One by one we tore in. Clothes, toys, video games—the works. Nothing was left out. We got everything we wanted and then some. There were a few mom gifts in there but you had to expect that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then we peeled open the best one, the only one that truly mattered once the dust settled: XBOX. And right beside it, Halo. A brand new console and a brand new game. I loved all my toys. I got the RC car I wanted, the big grey F-150. I got stuff I didn't even know I wanted. More GI-Joes, more everything. But Halo for XBOX was THE one. Me and my brother just weren't prepared for what was to come. Sometimes high expectations get passed like they're standing still.

           The story is the blood of a game, blood of anything, and Halo was one giant blood bag. The full title was <b><a href="halo.html">Halo: Combat Evolved<sup>3</sup></a></b>, and goddamn was the combat evolved. But the story held it all together. It had both the epicness and intimacy of Star Wars, but was its own thing. It's 500 years in the future where humans finally have the technology to ramble through space, aliens exist and they're not our friends. There are other aliens that are less advanced and are definitely not our friends. So you fought aliens in space. The goal was to stop them from gaining control of a superweapon that could threaten humanity. But that's just the bare bones of it. It sounds stupid because a story is a whole lot more than that. It was a freaking videogame but made most 200 million dollar movies look like utter shit. It walked on everything, sat on it too. As soon as Halo hit the shelves it was the only one.

            At 7AM my alarm went off and I went straight to the sock room. My brother was already in there, controller in hand. The XBOX booted up. Every time the game loaded you got the music, the space-operatic OOOOOOHHHHHHH OOOOOAWWHHHHH. The music was on another level.

            To THINK that the campaign was this good and would still just become a small footnote on the overall legacy of the game. It didn't seem possible. But it was just a tasty morsel to fish you in. Once you were in that OK piece of French bread you were eating was now toasted and buttered and filled with...cheese. Yes. The campaign set the bar high but the multiplayer, where you played against each other, broke the ceiling.

            My brother was on the portable phone. He laughed, hung up.

            "Eric, Halo at Ben's house at 3:30."

            "Cool," I said, but inside my geysers were exploding. I never organized anything, these were my brother's friends not mine. So it was up to him to make us both part of the group, to get the time and place, to include me. And he always did. He included me in everything.

            The Street Hockey crew was also the Halo crew, or most of them. And wouldn't you know it, Ben was by far the best at Halo too. God, couldn't we have anything? Was Ben even organic? I pushed my finger into his arm to see. He smacked me in the chest with the back of his hand.

            Halo at Ben's meant eight-person Halo. 4v4. You could play with up to four players on a single XBOX, and we did that plenty. The only problem was you could see other people's screen and know where they were on the map. It was cheating but everyone did it. I guess it gave everyone a maphack if you knew what you were doing, had the hang of the maps. Four-person Halo was great. It was good enough and we could go on playing it for eternity and be in Heaven. But 4v4 is what broke the ceiling. This was the highlight. 4v4 required TWO XBOXes. Which meant two TVs, two different rooms, and NO screen sharing. This was huge. It meant you really didn't know where your opponents were. You were together with your four-person team, on a single TV, going after the other four guys in the other room on their TV. You could strategize, you could play stealthy. Not to mention, shit man, it's just better with more players. Eight was the magic number.

            The game was always at Ben's because he had the nicest house. It was huge and it was clean. The exterior was white brick, the interior was spotless white carpet. Classic Asian household. It smelled like weird Asian spices. Ben's mom yelled at him constantly. He would have to pause the game sometimes to talk with her in Chinese. We just prayed we could continue playing. I closed my eyes, said a little prayer. Please Lord may Ben own his mom in this argument, please Lord make Ben's mom go away. Please Lord make 4v4 Halo my eternal existence. Amen.

            Ben re-emerged, said we could keep playing. More proof he was the best at everything. He repeatedly took the stand against his mom and sent her packing. Back to the couch, back to the kitchen, to Hell. Anywhere but here. JUST LET US PLAY OUR FUCKING GAME BITCH. Oh thank God.

            Last year, in 5th, I was the star of the play so I went out again this year. I thought I'd be a shoe in for the lead but 1st year of middle school and so forth, bottom of the food chain, I got a small part. I dropped it. I was pissed. I turned my attention elsewhere. I started noticing girls. They didn't notice me. I was still working off my baby fat and couldn't look them in the eye. I was also uncool. Man, middle school really sucked ass. This town was a big pile of shit and middle school just made it worse. People were starting to get mean. No one had the maturity to rise above anything and all the hormones were piling in. I had to get the hell out of there. I was trapped in that sterile building. How is this what we created? Who would ever put their kids here?

            It was another big push inward. I wasn't getting what I needed from the outside so had to go the other way. I'm so glad things sucked, though. It started to create something different inside, something I could use. Big cheers to the shitbag with the pink shirt and popped collar, always trying to beat people up. Extra special thanks to that clown Josh who stayed back two years and wouldn't shut the hell up in class. There were so many, I could never go through them all. I couldn't do them all justice. These people were made out of glass and plastic. They still are. I was sure I was better and that I didn't belong there.

            2:30 hit. The dumb bell rang. I crashed through the doors. ADIOS. Oxygen. I ran to my bus. I was one of the first ones on. CAN WE START THIS THING. I looked out the window at the sea of kids finding their buses, too. I had to figure out a way to get through this. I had six more years of it. There had to be something in here somewhere, some kind of lubricant. Not drugs of course, but something. Something that wasn't a drug but was a drug. I'd find it. I'd move things along the surface until it fell into place and meshed seamlessly. People would think I was interested and engaged but I'd be on Saturn. I started writing a book.

            I got in, threw my backpack off like it was a freaking monkey on my neck. It went flying. I floated up the stairs to my room. I had some kind of purpose. I just needed a fresh notebook. And if I didn't have one I'd get one. They were 99&#162; tops. 99&#162; could turn into $1M if you put the words in the right order. At the very least it would dig a tunnel between 6th grade and salvation. All I needed was one of those black and white marble sons of bitches and a pen. I didn't have a marble, I had a spiral. I used it. I turned to the first blank page, wrote TABLE OF CONTENTS. Bookmarked it for later. Flipped to several pages in, wrote "Chapter 1".
        </p>
        <p>
            I started writing. The faces of all the crappy kids just melted away. I was smiling. My mouth was going to be sore tomorrow I was smiling so freaking big. The story just flowed. I was at my desk 20 minutes and had the first chapter written. It wasn't much but it was something. I flipped back in the book and wrote the title. <b><a href="spacemarines.html">Space Marines: 2287<sup>4</sup></sup></a></b>. That was it. This was going to be it.
