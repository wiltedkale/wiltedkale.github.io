        9 character concepts for an action RPG / MOBA mix
        </b>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        We've always wondered what it would be like to combine an action RPG like Diablo with a battle arena like Heroes of the Storm. So we started drawing.
    </p>
    <p>
        What follows is just a rough outline, and perhaps the start of something. We love when games support self-expression, so we set out to design characters that would give players lots of choice as well as some fun tools to play with.
    </p>
    <br />
    <div class="divtrans">
        <p>
            <b>
                maximum character level = 20
        <br />
                maximum level of each skill = 10
        <br />
                total number of skills per character = 6
            </b>

    <h2>
        Ranger
    </h2>
    <p3>
        The ranger specializes in ranged combat (no shit?) and is typically responsible for dealing a lot of damage. In Kale RPG however, the ranger is suited for a wide range of playstyles: damage, poke, zoning, disruption, etc. 
    </p>

      <video style=""
        loop autoplay playsinline muted
        src="https://storage.googleapis.com/pls-everything-else/compost_heap/ea/KaleRPG_Classes/ranger_compd.mp4">
        </video>
    <p>
        The ranger can be skilled as a glass cannon damage dealer or an abstract and artistic character—the latter relying on stealth, hit-and-run, and crafty maneuvers to best enemies who would otherwise win in a straight up fight. 
    </p>
    <br />
    <img class="imgreg" src="kalerpg/rangerskills1.jpg">
    <img class="imgreg" src="kalerpg/rangerskills2.jpg">
    <br />
     <p>
        The ranger is designed for the kite lords—the players who like to click a lot and spam their stuff out. The APM gods smile upon the ranger.
    </p>
    <br />
    <img src="kalerpg/section_divider.jpg">
    <h2>
        Monk
    </h2>
    <p>
        Taking inspiration from EverQuest, Diablo 3, and Heroes of the Storm, the monk is a balanced amalgam of snappy, agile combat and ample self-sustain.
    </p>
    <br />
    <video style=""
    loop autoplay playsinline muted
    src="https://storage.googleapis.com/pls-everything-else/compost_heap/ea/KaleRPG_Classes/monk_compd.mp4">
    </video>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
        The monk boasts skills in hand-to-hand combat, healing, and mobility—easy to learn but very difficult to master.
    </p>
    <br />
    <img class="imgreg" src="kalerpg/monkskills1.jpg">
    <img class="imgreg" src="kalerpg/monkskills2.jpg">
    <br />
    <p>
        We see the monk as one of the more competitive characters that highly skilled players would enjoy. Lots of stuff to do, constant clicking—punishable but also rewarding.
    </p>
    <br />
    <img src="kalerpg/section_divider.jpg">
    <br />
    <h2>
     Enchanter
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Enchanter specializes in disruption, illusion, and crowd control, with some single target damage to boot. She plays like a support mage, employing various tricks to confuse and disturb enemies—to the point of infuriation!
    </p>
    <video style=""
    loop autoplay playsinline muted
    src="https://storage.googleapis.com/pls-everything-else/compost_heap/ea/KaleRPG_Classes/enchanter_compdd.mp4">
    </video>
    <br />
    <p>
        Enchanters aren't designed to deal the most damage: they prefer to whittle enemies down over time or drive them away after provoking a bit of madness.
    </p>
    <br />
    <img class="imgreg" src="kalerpg/enchanterskills1.jpg">
    <img class="imgreg" src="kalerpg/enchanterskills2.jpg">
    <br />
    <p>
        The enchanter's skills come together to create a fun, quick and disorienting (for the enemy) character. A player can choose to spec more heavily into the disruptive abilities or into the support abilities depending on personal style.
    </p>
    <br />
    <img src="kalerpg/section_divider.jpg">
    <br />
    <h2>
        Fighter
    </h2>
    <p>
        The fighter is suited for players who have no fear; who face-check the fog of war and line of sight blockers; who initiate without thinking; who run it down even as their team dies behind them; who like to take a beating while dishing one out themselves.
    </p>
    <br />
    <video style=""
    loop autoplay playsinline muted
    src="https://storage.googleapis.com/pls-everything-else/compost_heap/ea/KaleRPG_Classes/fighter_comp.mp4">
    </video>
    <br />
    <p>
        The fighter is an excellent duelist and can even be effective at range. Some of the skills are references to the movie Gladiator. If you know, you know.
    </p>
    <img class="imgreg" src="kalerpg/fighterskills1.jpg">
    <img class="imgreg" src="kalerpg/fighterskills2.jpg">
    <br />
    <p>
        In Kale RPG, the fighter is designed as a true "sword and board" character. If a shield isn't equipped, chonky gauntlets can sometimes suffice.
    </p>
    <br />
    <img src="kalerpg/section_divider.jpg">
    <br />

    <h2>
        Rogue
    </h2>
    <p>
        The rogue is a lore-rich and historically beloved (and despised) archetype that couldn't be left on the cutting room floor.
    </p>
    <p>
        For some reason, many people are attracted to the rogue fantasy. Is it because rogues are violent murderers that get away with it? Are we all just sick puppies?
    </p>
    <br />
    <video style=""
    loop autoplay playsinline muted
    src="https://storage.googleapis.com/pls-everything-else/compost_heap/ea/KaleRPG_Classes/rogue1_comp.mp4">
    </video>
    <br />
    <p>
        In Kale RPG, the rogue is designed to be strong but not without its weaknesses. We want it to fulfill the stealth assassin fantasy but also be difficult to play—ultimately rewarding the player who puts the time and effort in.
    </p>

    <br />
    <img class="imgreg" src="kalerpg/rogueskills1.jpg">
    <img class="imgreg" src="kalerpg/rogueskills2.jpg">
    <br />
    <p>
        The rogue's skills hopefully start to crack at the fantasy of a dark and plotting "combo" character without giving the class too many tools that are frustrating to play against.
    </p>
    <br />
    <img src="kalerpg/section_divider.jpg">

    <h2>
        Bard
    </h2>
    <p>
        Does anyone really know what a bard is? Sure, he's traditionally a support magic wielder who sometimes throws down in martial combat, but he's always felt a little out of place next to the warriors, wizards and rogues. He's here because he's different and brings a certain flavaH.
    </p>
     <video style=""
    loop autoplay playsinline muted
    src="https://storage.googleapis.com/pls-everything-else/compost_heap/ea/KaleRPG_Classes/bard_comp.mp4">
    </video>
    <br />
    <p>
        Somehow, playing instruments releases magic that can either damage enemies or support allies. It's a cool concept and a little metaphorical to boot. We took it all the way.
    </p>
    <br />
    <img class="imgreg" src="kalerpg/bardskills1.jpg">
    <img class="imgreg" src="kalerpg/bardskills2.jpg">
    <br />
    <p>
        We decided to have a little extra fun with the bard. Bards are weird. Gotta have the bard though.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Shaman
    </h2>
    <p>
        Grab your furs and  tighten your spurs and wield the power of the elements! Let the strength of Poseidon flow through you, baby. Shamans rock. No, they RAIN.
    </p>
    <br />
    <video style=""
    loop autoplay playsinline muted
    src="https://storage.googleapis.com/pls-everything-else/compost_heap/ea/KaleRPG_Classes/shaman_comp.mp4">
    </video>
    <br />
    <p>
        In some games, such as Warcraft, the shaman calls on both elemental and ancestral power. Here we focus on elemental power. The shaman's kit is split between supportive healing and crowd control abilities as well as some strong damage abilities.
    </p>
    <img class="imgreg" src="kalerpg/shamanskills1.jpg">
    <img class="imgreg" src="kalerpg/shamanskills2.jpg">
    <br />
    <p>
        We've seen shamans in MMOs before, like EverQuest and World of Warcraft, and of course Heroes of the Storm, but we haven't seen a good shaman fantasy fulfilled in an action RPG. Diablo tried to do a shaman thing with the witch doctor in Diablo 3 but it just didn't have it.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Shadow Knight
    </h2>
    <p>
        Generally speaking, a shadow knight is a warrior who has traveled the dark path and learned forbidden forms of magic, such as necromancy.
    </p>
    <br />
    <video style=""
    loop autoplay playsinline muted
    src="https://storage.googleapis.com/pls-everything-else/compost_heap/ea/KaleRPG_Classes/sk_compd.mp4">
    </video>
    <br />
    <p>
        We worked in a few dollops of sorcery into his kit to bring out that warrior-mage/warrior-necro fantasy while ensuring he's markedly different from the fighter.
    </p>
    <br />
    <img class="imgreg" src="kalerpg/skskills1.jpg">
    <img class="imgreg" src="kalerpg/skskills2.jpg">
    <br />
    <p>
        The shadow knight is a unique character who can throw down in martial combat but also deal damage from range. A player can also choose to skill up 'raise dead' if they enjoy the skeleton army fantasy.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>
        Druid
    </h2>

    <p>
        Explore a mixture of feral, nuking, and crowd control skills. The druid fulfills the fantasy of the vengeful warrior of the forest. You wouldn't want to meet this wood-warden in the wrong apple patch. 
    </p>
    <br />
    <img class="imgreg" src="kalerpg/druidskills1.jpg">
    <img class="imgreg" src="kalerpg/druidskills2.jpg">
    <br />
    <p>
        There's something very appealing about rolling a heroic druid in this day and age. Root, rush, and swipe the bad people who have done the world harm.
    </p>
    <br />
    <img src="kalerpg/section_divider.jpg">
    <p>
        That's all we have! We hope you enjoyed this slightly more personal project about what <i>we</i> would like to see in a modern game.
